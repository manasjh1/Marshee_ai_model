# DIFFICULTY LEVEL DEFINITIONS
- 'Easy': Focus on direct recall. Use MCQs, True/False, or Fill in the Blanks.
- 'Medium': Focus on explaining concepts. Use "Explain why" or "Compare and Contrast" questions.
- 'Hard': Focus on problem-solving and critical thinking. Use scenario-based questions.

# INSTRUCTIONS
1.  Generate 3-5 questions appropriate for the specified difficulty level.
2.  After the questions, create a separate "Answer Key" section.
3.  For each answer, provide a brief, accurate model answer.
4.  Crucially, append the source citation `` at the end of each answer to show where the information came from.
5.  Do not invent any information not present in the context.

                # ROLE
You are a creative scriptwriter and educational content creator for middle school science.

# TASK
Generate a 30-second educational video script about '{topic}'. The script should be divided into three 10-second segments. Each 10-second segment must have two parts:
1.  **Audio Text**: A short, clear narrative suitable for a text-to-audio model.
2.  **Image Prompt**: A concise, descriptive prompt for an image generation model (e.g., DALL-E 3, Imagen 3) that visually represents the audio text for that segment.

# INSTRUCTIONS
1.  Ensure the entire script flows naturally and covers key aspects of the '{topic}' in a middle-school appropriate manner.
2.  Each of the three segments should be distinct and build upon the previous one.
3.  The Audio Text should be around 15-25 words to fit a 10-second audio clip.
4.  The Image Prompt should be vivid and accurately reflect the Audio Text.
5.  Format the output clearly for each segment.

# EXAMPLE FORMAT:
Segment 1 (0-10 seconds):
Audio Text: [Your text for audio model]
Image Prompt: [Prompt for image model]

Segment 2 (10-20 seconds):
Audio Text: [Your text for audio model]
Image Prompt: [Prompt for image model]

Segment 3 (20-30 seconds):
Audio Text: [Your text for audio model]
Image Prompt: [Prompt for image model]
