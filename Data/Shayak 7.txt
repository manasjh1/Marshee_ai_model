Earth, Moon, and
the Sun

One morning in Kanniyakumari, Tamil Nadu, 12-year-old
Rashmika was eagerly cycling to school. She was excited. That was
the day her science teacher had dedicated a class for students to
share and try to explain interesting observations.
Rashmika had been noticing that the coconut tree shadows
were long in the morning but shorter in the afternoon on her
way back. She thought about it and decided that the size of the
shadows changed because the Sun moved across the sky during
the day. But she also remembered learning that the Earth moved
around the Sun (in chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the Grade 6 Science
textbook Curiosity) so she was puzzled. She wondered — does the
Sun move in the sky? Or does the Earth move?


12.1 Rotation of the Earth
You might have also noticed that the Sun rises in the East and sets in
the West. Have you ever wondered why? Let us try to understand
why. Have you ever enjoyed riding a merry-go-round at a park or
at your school? Let us go back to riding a merry-go-round!

Activity 12.1: Let us explore
 Sit on a merry-go-round facing towards the outer side as
shown in Fig. 12.1.
 Ask someone to turn the merry-goround slowly in the anti-clockwise
direction as shown in Fig. 12.1. While
you are sitting on the moving merrygo-round, look around you. Do the
objects around you appear to be
moving? In which direction do they
appear to be moving?

Curiosity Textbook of Science Grade 7

Fig. 12.1: A girl observing objects around
her while riding a merry-go-round

While you turn in the anti-clockwise
direction, the objects appear to turn
around you in the opposite direction, that
is, in the clockwise direction.
 Now ﬁx your gaze at a particular tree
(or a building) ahead of you while
sitting on the merry- go-round turning
around in anti-clockwise direction.

In which direction do you ﬁnd the tree turning around you? Is
it in your view all the time?
The tree appears to turn around you in the opposite direction,
that is, the clockwise direction. The tree appears in your view
from your left-hand side and then moves out of your view on the
right-hand side when you view it from a merry-go-round turning
around in anti-clockwise direction.
Using the observations made by us while riding a merry-goround, let us now think. When we view from the Earth, the Sun
appears in the East, moves across the sky from the East to the West
and disappears in the West. Does it indicate that the Sun is moving
in the sky? Or might it be that the Earth itself is turning around
and the Sun just appears to move?
The fact is that the Sun appears to be moving because we view
it from the Earth, which is turning around itself.

(a)

Earth, Moon, and the Sun

In which way is the Earth turning around itself? To visualise
this, let us recall some of the objects which turn around themselves.
Have you watched a top spinning around its spindle (Fig. 12.2a)?
Or a spinning fan (Fig. 12.2b)? Or tried spinning a ball (Fig. 12.2c)?

Rotation is the motion of an object
in which all its parts move in circles
around an imaginary line that passes
through it. This line is called the axis
of rotation.

Let us now further explore
to understand how day and
night occur on the Earth due
to its rotation.

 Use a torch to represent the Sun. Go
to a relatively dark room to carry
out the further steps of the activity.
 Now, shine light from the torch
placed at some distance, say
1.5 metres, on the globe as shown in
Fig. 12.4b. Do you notice how half
of the globe receives the light from
the torch, while the other half stays

It is day time in that half of the globe
which receives light, and night time in

rotate the globe in one direction and then in the opposite

the eastern part of India ﬁrst?

Curiosity Textbook of Science Grade 7

The light falls on the eastern part of India ﬁrst when the globe
rotates from West to East with respect to the North-South axis of
the globe.
 Now while rotating the globe from West to East, observe your
location on the Earth. Does it go through a cycle of day and
night?
Sunrise occurs as your location moves into light and sunset
occurs as it moves into darkness.
The Earth’s rotation from West to East causes the day-night
cycle. As shown in Fig. 12.5, the side facing the Sun experiences
daytime, while the other side is dark and experiences night.

Due to the rotation of the Earth, the Sun appears to rise in the
eastward direction, move across the sky from the East to the West
and set in the westward direction (Fig. 12.6). Then the night begins
and the stars become visible in the sky.

FASCINATING FACTS

In an earlier chapter ‘Measurement of Time and
Motion’, you learnt how the scientist Galileo
discovered an important property of a pendulum,
and in the seventeenth century, another scientist,
Huygens, used that property to make pendulum
clocks that measured time. In the middle of
nineteenth century, another scientist, Leon
Foucault, used a long pendulum to give the ﬁrst
simple demonstration of the Earth’s rotation. The
pendulum, known as a Foucault pendulum in his
honour, consists of a long string with a heavy bob,
suspended from a high ceiling.
A Foucault pendulum with a length of 22 metres
has been hung from a skylight in the Constitution
Hall of the new Parliament building in New Delhi,
India. It symbolises the integration of the idea of
India with the vastness of the cosmos.

Since the Earth is rotating,
shouldn’t the stars also
appear to move in the sky
like the Sun?

Yes, indeed! Let us look at the
stars in the night sky to see the
eﬀect of Earth’s rotation.

 After two hours, observe the Big Dipper again. Has it moved?
Again, draw its orientation and note down the time.
 Repeat the above step after two hours. Do you observe that
the Big Dipper appears to move around the Pole Star (notice
just the movement even if you cannot see the Pole Star)?
The Earth’s axis of rotation points very close to the Pole Star in
the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, the Pole Star appears nearly
stationary in the sky from the Earth. All the stars appear to move
around it. Just like the Sun, the Moon also appears to rise in the
eastward direction and set in the westward direction because the
Earth rotates from West to East.

FASCINATING FACTS

Astrophotographers take long exposure
photographs, keeping the camera’s
shutter open for a long time. In such
a photograph, the apparent motion of
the stars is recorded as arcs of a circle,
known as star trails.

FASCINATING FACTS

Ancient Indian astronomers, including Aryabhata, had also
noticed the daily apparent motion of the celestial objects, such
as the Sun, Moon, planets and stars. Aryabhata was a famous
mathematician and astronomer of ancient India who wrote an
important treatise, Aryabhatiya, around the ﬁfth century CE. The
apparent motion of the stars due to the rotation of the Earth is
explained in Verse 9, Golapada, Aryabhatiya.

Earth, Moon, and the Sun



Just as a man in a boat moving forward sees stationary objects as
moving backwards, so also the stars that are stationary are seen
by people of Lanka as moving towards the west.
Aryabhata’s stated value for the time taken by the Earth to
complete one full rotation about its axis is around 23 hours 56
minutes 4.1 seconds (in modern units). This value is impressively
close to the currently accepted value.

I have seen that the stars and
constellations that appear in the
East at sunset change during
diﬀerent months.

Yes. Maybe that is why we were told to
look for certain stars and constellations at
certain times of the year in Grade 6. But,
why do diﬀerent stars appear in the night
sky over the course of a year?

12.2 Revolution of the Earth
While rotating on its own axis, the Earth also revolves around the Sun
as we learnt in Grade 6. This movement is diﬀerent from rotation.
Revolution is the motion of an object around another object.


The path an object takes while revolving around another object
is called its orbit. If viewed from the top (Fig. 12.8), the orbit of the
Earth around the Sun is nearly circular. (In the ﬁgure of the Solar
System given in chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the Grade 6 Science
textbook Curiosity, the orbit appeared elongated because it was
a side view of the orbit). The Earth completes one revolution
around the Sun in about 365 days and 6 hours.

12.2.1 Changing view of night sky from the Earth
Every evening the Sun sets in the westward direction and the night
sky becomes visible. We know that this occurs due to the Earth’s
rotation. As the Earth also revolves around the Sun continuously,
the stars seen in the night sky after sunset gradually change over
a year as we look in diﬀerent directions, as shown in Fig. 12.8.

time of the night, on days separated by a month.

The Bhil and Pawara are indigenous communities from the Tapi Valley

I have noticed that we go
through a cycle of seasons
every year. Is it related to
the revolution of the Earth
around the Sun in some
way?

Earth, Moon, and the Sun

12.2.2 Seasons on the Earth

I have also noticed
that days are longer
in summer than in
winter.

The Earth’s axis of rotation is not upright with respect to the
orbit, but is tilted. The Earth maintains this tilt as it orbits around
the Sun (Fig. 12.9). The tilt of the Earth’s axis and the spherical
shape of the Earth gives rise to seasons. Let us ﬁnd out, how.

top view. The sizes and distances are not to scale)

In June, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun while
the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun (Fig. 12.9).
As seen in Fig. 12.10a, a given amount of sunrays are spread in
a smaller area in the Northern Hemisphere as compared to the
Southern Hemisphere due to the spherical shape of the Earth’s
surface. So that area is heated more.
Further, the Northern Hemisphere receives sunlight for more
than 12 hours in June (Fig. 12.11a). So, the Northern Hemisphere
experiences more intense sunlight, which lasts for a longer time,
causing the summer season. In December, the situation is opposite
in the Northern Hemisphere and it experiences winter season
with sunlight for shorter time (Fig. 12.10b and Fig. 12.11b).

Two incorrect reasons often given to explain why seasons occur
on the Earth are:
 When the Northern Hemisphere tilts towards the Sun, it is
closer to the Sun.
 The orbit of the Earth is an oval with the Sun slightly displaced
from its centre so the Earth is at diﬀerent distances from the
Sun over the year.
However, the diﬀerence in distances in either of these cases is
very small and these are not the reasons why seasons occur on
the Earth. In fact, the Earth is closest to the Sun in January.


In the Northern Hemisphere, the longest day occurs around
21 June—this is known as summer solstice. After the summer
solstice, the duration of a day becomes shorter while that of a
night becomes longer. The shortest day and longest night in this
Hemisphere occur around 22 December known as the winter
solstice. Around 21 March and 23 September, the daytime lasts
for 12 hours. In the Northern Hemisphere, these days are called
the spring and the autumn equinox, respectively.

At the North Pole, the Sun rises in the East direction on the equinox
day — 21 March, and remains continuously in the sky for six months.
The Sun sets on 22 September. The South Pole experiences the opposite
behaviour. The polar regions thus experience continuous sunshine for
six months followed by a six-month period of darkness.

On the equator, there is always 12 hours of sunlight and 12
hours of darkness. There is little diﬀerence in the intensity of the
sunrays falling on the equator in diﬀerent months. Thus, for the
southern states of India that lie close to the equator, the eﬀect
of seasons is not very prominent. Other eﬀects, such as local
geographical features and proximity to oceans or seas, can also
inﬂuence these broader patterns seen in the two hemispheres, as
you have learnt in social science.

12.3 Eclipses
Day and night cycle, seasons, the life
on the Earth... so much is dependent
upon the Sun. Could the light from the
Sun get blocked by the two planets
which are revolving between the
Earth and the Sun?

The planets Mercury and Venus appear very small compared to
the Sun, and never block the entire light from the Sun reaching
us. However, you may be surprised to know that the Moon can
do that. Do you remember studying in Grade 6 that the Moon is a
natural satellite of the Earth and it revolves around the Earth as
the Earth revolves around the Sun?

12.3.1 Solar eclipse
At certain times, the Moon can come in between the Sun and the
Earth in a way that obstructs the light from the Sun from reaching
us. This is known as a solar eclipse. You may wonder how the
Moon, which is smaller than the Sun, blocks the light coming from
the Sun that we see in the sky.

 Now close one eye and show a thumbs up with your
outstretched hand towards your friend as shown in Fig. 12.12.

You can cover the entire head of your friend
with the help of your thumb, even though your
thumb is much smaller than the actual size of
your friend’s head. How could it be? The size of
any object as seen by your eye — also known as
apparent size — depends upon both its actual
physical size and its distance from you. The

The apparent sizes of the Moon and the Sun in the sky are
similar when viewed from the Earth. This is so because though
the Moon is much smaller in physical size than the Sun, the Moon
is much closer to us compared to the Sun. Therefore, the Moon
can appear to cover the entire Sun as viewed from the Earth.

D

IVE
EEPER

Though the planets Mercury and Venus are much larger than
the Moon in size, they are also much farther from the Earth as
compared to the Moon. Thus, their apparent sizes are very much
smaller than the Sun and they cannot block the Sun. For example,
when Venus passes between the Sun and the Earth, it appears as
a tiny black dot passing against the bright face of the Sun. This
event, known as a Transit of Venus, is a rare event.

Figure 12.13 shows the arrangement of the Sun, the Moon, and
the Earth during a solar eclipse. The shadow of the Moon falls on
a small area on the surface of the Earth as seen in Fig. 12.13. This
area is in total darkness, and no part of the Sun can be seen from
there. The observers in this area witness a total solar eclipse
(Fig. 12.14a).

In areas where the Moon partially blocks out only some
regions of the Sun, the observers see a partial solar eclipse
(Fig. 12.13 and Fig. 12.14b).
During a total solar eclipse, for a few minutes it turns dark
during the day as no sunlight reaches the Earth. Due to the
Earth’s rotation and the motion of the Moon in its orbit, the
Moon’s shadow moves across the surface of the Earth. Thus, the
total solar eclipse is visible only for a few minutes. As the Moon
begins to move away from the front of the Sun (Fig. 12.14c), we
see a partial solar eclipse and daylight begins to return.

Safe Viewing of a Solar Eclipse

Caution — During a solar eclipse, one might be tempted to look at the
Sun, thinking that it wouldn’t be strong enough to cause harm to our
eyes. However, even during the eclipse, the Sun is intense enough to
damage the eyes and cause blindness. Thus, directly viewing solar
eclipse must be strictly avoided. Also, do not view it through sunglasses,
binoculars, or telescopes.

This activity, similar to Activity 11.5, is to be set up by your
teacher. A mirror can be used to project an image of the
Sun onto a wall. However, holding it at the correct angle
throughout a solar eclipse can be diﬃcult. To solve this, make
a movable stand for the mirror. Use a hollow ball with a small
hole, half-ﬁll it with sand (to keep it stable), and attach a small
mirror (such as an embroidery mirror) to it. Place the ball on
a circular ring, like an adhesive tape ring, so it can be turned
around easily. Adjust it until the Sun’s image appears on a
wall or screen. Fig. 12.15 shows this set-up where the mirror
is ﬁxed to a green ball.

People have observed eclipses and maintained records since
ancient times. When the reasons for eclipses were not known, they
feared the occurrence of eclipses. As you can imagine, something
blocking the Sun, the main source of heat and light on the Earth,
even for a brief period of time, would have been extremely
concerning. Many superstitions were attached to solar eclipses in
various parts of the world related to the activities that could not
be carried out during eclipses—such as eating, cooking, or going
out of home. But now that we know the reason why a solar eclipse
occurs, we need not fear these events as long as we do not look at
the Sun directly. In fact, scientists go around the world to observe
the eclipses from wherever these are observable. The eclipses
provide them an opportunity to study phenomena that cannot be
observed otherwise.

An eclipse is known as grahan in Sanskrit and in many Indian languages.

in rhythmic shlokas.

12.3.2 Lunar eclipse
As the Moon revolves around the Earth, sometimes the Earth can
block the sunlight from reaching the Moon. This is known as a
lunar eclipse. On such days, we see the Earth’s shadow falling on
the full disc of the Moon. Fig. 12.16 shows the arrangement of the

When the Moon is completely in the Earth’s shadow, it is

to appear dark red in colour and stays that way until the Moon
moves out of the shadow of the Earth. When part of the Moon
is in the Earth’s shadow and the rest of the Moon is visible, it
is called a partial lunar eclipse. Unlike the Sun, we can safely
watch the eclipsed full Moon with our naked eye.

(i) Ravikiran used a solar eclipse goggle.
(ii) Jyothi used a mirror to project the Sun’s image.
(iii) Adithya saw the Sun directly with his eyes.

INNOVATION

(iv) Aruna attended a programme arranged by a planetarium.
8. Fill in the circles in Fig. 12.18 appropriately with one of the
following: Sun, Moon, Earth.

9. The Moon is much smaller than the Sun, yet it can block the
Sun completely from our view during a total solar eclipse.
Why is it possible?
10. The Indian cricket team matches in Australia are often held
in December. Should they pack winter or summer clothes for
their trip?
11. Why do you think lunar eclipses can be seen from a large
part of the Earth when they happen, but total solar eclipse
can be seen by only a small part of the Earth?

Disciplinary

12. If the Earth’s axis were not tilted with respect to the axis of
revolution, explain what would be the eﬀect on seasons?

Exploratory Projects
 Repeat Activity 12.2 but replace the torch with an electric
lamp. Then place the globe at diﬀerent positions on a circle
around the lamp while maintaining the tilt of the globe.

Art

(i) Note down your observations regarding how much of
the Northern and Southern hemispheres of the globe are
illuminated at diﬀerent positions.
(ii) Rotate the globe and take a note of the length of the day
and night on diﬀerent parts of the globe.
(iii) Repeat (ii) for diﬀerent positions of globe on the circle.

Geography

 The Earth goes around the Sun in an oval-shaped path.
Draw two circles with the same centre, one with a radius of
14.7 cm, and another one with a radius of 15.2 cm. If 1 cm
corresponds to 10 million km, the two circles represent the
closest and farthest distances from the Sun. Note how small
is the diﬀerence between these two distances.
 Suppose the tilt of the Earth’s axis of rotation increases. Will
it cause more extreme seasons? Find out if the tilt of Uranus
is more than the Earth and about the seasons there. Write an
interesting article for a newspaper or your school magazine
about it.

In reality, the planets move around a special point in
the solar system, which is very close to the Sun but
not exactly at its centre! The Sun also moves around
the same point a little instead of staying perfectly still.
Scientists use such tiny wobbles in the movement of
other stars to discover exoplanets around them!



It's Still Not the End, My Friend!
And once again, we’ve reached the last page of this book, and as
we said earlier, it is certainly not the end of our curiosity — our
jigyasa. We hope you’ve enjoyed the activities and experiments as
you journeyed through the chapters. More importantly, we hope
you asked a lot of questions! Now it is our time to ask you one.
Have you looked closely at the front and back covers of
this science textbook? At ﬁrst, they may just look like regular
scenes from a playground or a running track, but if you observe
carefully, you’ll ﬁnd tiny hidden science clues connected to
diﬀerent chapters in the book! Take a closer look — maybe you
will spot something related to what we discussed about motion
or light, or maybe even about plants and animals?
Challenge yourself to ﬁnd as many science links with the
chapters as you can (we think there are more than 25!). And
who knows — you might ﬁnd connections that the authors and
illustrators hadn’t even thought about! That is exactly how
discoveries in science were made — by someone just observing
something new, something unusual in the world around them.
This textbook is just a small guide, a map to ﬁnd our way
around the diﬀerent paths of science. Never stop asking questions,
and remember, your curiosity is the spark that lights the ﬂame
of exploration that will take you to incredible heights. And we’ll
join you again, next year, for more adventures in science.
