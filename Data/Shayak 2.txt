If your food is fully digested before you eat again, you won’t need medicine for pain.
(Thirukkural 942)

In the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, chapter ‘Living
Creatures: Exploring their Characteristics’, we learnt about
processes essential for survival of living beings like nutrition,
respiration, excretion, and reproduction. These are collectively
called life processes. In this chapter, we will learn about life
processes such as nutrition and respiration in detail.

Observe your surroundings and notice what animals eat.
Animals eat diﬀerent types of food. Bees and sunbirds suck the nectar
of ﬂowers, while infants of humans and many other animals feed on
their mother’s milk. Snakes, like python, swallow the animals they
prey upon. Some aquatic animals ﬁlter tiny food particles ﬂoating
nearby and feed upon them.
Animals, including humans, obtain
energy from food, which enables them to
carry out various life processes. Animals
consume food that contains complex
components, such as carbohydrate, protein,
and fat. These complex food components
have to be broken down into simpler forms
before the body can use them. But how does
this process happen?
Breaking down of complex food
components into simpler forms occurs in a
long tube called the alimentary canal. This
process starts in the mouth and ends at the
anus (Fig. 9.1). As food moves through this
canal, digestive juices secreted at diﬀerent
parts break it down into simpler forms.
This simpler form of food is absorbed by
diﬀerent parts of our alimentary canal and
transported to various parts of our body to
carry out various functions.

9.1 Nutrition in Animals
How do the complex food components get broken down into
simpler forms and used by the body in various animals? Is this
process the same in all animals or does it vary? Let us ﬁrst try to
understand this process in humans.

9.1.1 Digestion in human beings
Let us trace the journey of food inside our body as it passes
through diﬀerent parts of the alimentary canal.
Beginning with the mouth cavity

The journey of the food you eat begins when it enters your
mouth. Your teeth break down food you eat into smaller pieces
by the processes of crushing and chewing. This process of initial
breakdown of food into ﬁne pieces is called mechanical digestion.
Think about your favourite food. Does your mouth feel watery?

This happens because of more saliva that gets released when you
recall your favourite food.
What do you think is the role of saliva in your mouth? What
do you feel when you eat other types of food, such as chapati? Let
us ﬁnd out.
Take a small piece of chapati or a bite-sized portion of boiled
rice and chew it properly for 30–60 seconds. At ﬁrst, the chapati
or rice has its usual taste, but as you continue chewing, do you
notice a change in taste? The food begins to taste sweet! Have you
ever wondered why this happens?
Chapati or rice contains starch, which is a type of carbohydrate.
Our saliva contains a digestive juice that helps break down starch
into sugar. This explains why starchy food, like chapati, tastes
sweet when you chew it for a long time. Saliva helps to break
down components of food into simpler ones.

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY

A healthy mouth requires good oral hygiene. We should brush our
teeth and clean our tongue twice a day, and rinse our mouth with
water after each meal to prevent tooth decay and bad smell in the
mouth. Find out the ways our elders were maintaing oral hygiene.

Activity 9.1: Let us investigate
 Take two test tubes and label them as ‘A’ and ‘B’.
 Take one teaspoonful of boiled rice in test tube A, and take a
teaspoonful of boiled rice after chewing it for 30–60 seconds
in test tube B.
 Add 3–4 mL of water in both the test tubes.
 Note the initial colour of the rice-water mixture in Table 9.1.
 Add 3–4 drops of iodine solution into each test tube with the
help of a dropper. Mix the content of each test tube separately
and observe.
Record your observations in Table 9.1.

Did you observe that the colour of boiled rice turned blue-black
in test tube A, while in test tube B, chewed boiled rice either did
not change colour or turned only a very light blue-black colour?
What causes the change of colour in test tube A? In Grade 6, we
learned that iodine gives a blue-black colour when it reacts with
starch. In test tube A, the appearance of the blue-black colour
indicates the presence of starch. In test tube B, which contains
chewed boiled rice, if there is no change in colour, it indicates
that the starch is no longer present; if there is only a slight
change in colour, it indicates that starch is present only in very
small amount. It has been broken down into simple sugars by
the action of saliva. If the colour still appears in test tube B, what
changes would you make in the activity to explore it further?
Would the colour change if chewing time is increased? Try to
ﬁnd out by repeating the activity.
Now, we know that saliva secretion in the mouth helps break
down starch into sugars. This process of breaking complex food
components into simpler forms in the body is called digestion. Food
is partially digested in the mouth. Let us learn how this partially
digested food gets further digested through the alimentary canal.

Fig. 9.2: Movement of food in the food pipe

When you chew your food, your
saliva not only helps in digesting
the starch but also moistens
it, making it soft and easy to
swallow. Your tongue helps in
mixing chewed food with saliva
and pushing this softened food
into a long, ﬂexible tube called
the food pipe or oesophagus
(Fig. 9.2). But how does the food
move down?

The walls of the food pipe gently contract and relax in a
wave-like motion to push the food down into the stomach. This
movement takes place throughout the alimentary canal and
pushes the food forward.
Stomach

In the stomach, the walls contract and relax to churn the food. The
churned food is then mixed with a secretion from the inner lining
of the stomach. The secretion from stomach contains digestive juice,
acid, and mucus.


The digestive juice of the stomach breaks
down proteins present in the food into simpler
components.
The acid not only helps break down proteins
but also kills many harmful bacteria. The mucus
protects the stomach lining from the acid, preventing
damage. In the stomach, the food is partially digested
and transformed into a semi-liquid mass, preparing
it for the next stage of digestion.

FASCINATING FACTS

How did scientists learn about digestion in the human body?
The discovery of how the stomach works happened
by chance. In 1822, a man named Alexis St. Martin
was accidentally shot in the stomach. He was treated
by a doctor, William Beaumont. However, his wound
never fully healed, leaving a small permanent hole.
This opening allowed Dr. Beaumont to observe
digestion in the stomach as it happened. He conducted
Alexis St. Martin’s
experiments on how diﬀerent foods were broken
shotgun wound
down and studied how emotions aﬀect digestion.

Small Intestine

After its journey through the stomach, the partially
digested food moves into the small intestine. Look
at Fig. 9.4. It is a sketch of a stretched-out alimentary
canal. Guess how long it is. You will be surprised
that although it is called small intestine, it is almost
6 metres long—almost twice the height of your
classroom! You will be surprised to know that the
small intestine is the longest part of the alimentary
canal.
The small intestine receives digestive secretions
from three sources—the inner lining of the small
intestine itself, and two more structures associated
with the alimentary canal—the liver and the
pancreas (Fig. 9.4). The liver secretes bile, which
is mildly basic in nature. Recall the neutralisation
reaction in chapter ‘Exploring Substances: Acidic,
Basic, and Neutral’. Bile neutralises acids present
in the food moving down from the stomach and
breaks down fats into tiny droplets, making its
digestion easier.

The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice, which is also
basic in nature and helps neutralise acids present in the food.
Additionally, pancreatic juice also breaks down carbohydrates,
proteins, and fats. The digestive juice secreted by the wall of the
small intestine further breaks down fats, proteins, and partially
digested carbohydrates into simpler forms.
The digested nutrients pass on
from the small intestine into the blood
present in blood vessels found in the
walls of the small intestine. This process
is called absorption of nutrients. How
are these nutrients absorbed from
the small intestine? The inner lining
of the small intestine is thin and has
thousands of ﬁnger-like projections
(Fig. 9.5) that increase the surface
0.5 mm
area for eﬃcient nutrient absorption.
These ﬁnger-like projections allow
Fig. 9.5: Inner lining of the small intestine
the digested nutrients to pass into the
blood, which carries them to diﬀerent parts of the body. These
nutrients provide energy, support growth and repair, and help
the body function properly.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY

Celiac disease is a condition in which the body reacts
to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.
This reaction damages the inner lining of the small
intestine, where nutrients are absorbed. As a result,
the intestine cannot function properly. The only way
to manage celiac disease is to avoid foods that contain
gluten. Millets (like jowar, bajra, and ragi) are good
alternatives because they are naturally gluten-free.

Large intestine
After most of the nutrients are digested and absorbed in the
small intestine, what happens to the undigested food? It moves
into the large intestine. The large intestine is about 1.5 metres
in length. It is shorter than the small intestine. Then why is it
called the large intestine? The reason is that it is wider than the

126

Chapter 9.indd 126

4/3/2025 4:55:11 PM

small intestine. The large intestine absorbs water and some salts
from the undigested food, thus making the waste semi-solid. This
semi-solid waste is called stool. The stool is then stored in the
lower part of the large intestine, called the rectum, until the
body is ready to get rid of it. Eating ﬁbre-rich foods like fruits,
vegetables, and whole grains helps the large intestine function
properly by making the stool easier to pass. Finally, it is expelled
through the anus—a process known as egestion. This is how your
body removes the waste it does not need, keeping you healthy!
Isn’t it fascinating how the digestive system works, absorbing
nutrients from food and eliminating waste?

Life Processes in Animals

127

FASCINATING FACTS

The large intestine contains various small living organisms,
such as bacteria, that help in digestion. They help in keeping our
digestive system healthy. They break down undigested food,
especially ﬁbre, and produce essential nutrients. Fibre-rich
food, and especially ‘fermented foods’ (like curd, buttermilk,
shrikhand, kanji, pickles, gundruk, and poita bhat) are good for
a healthy digestive system and overall well-being.

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY

The importance of digestion in maintaining good health has been
recognised for centuries. The Charaka Samhita, an ancient Ayurvedic
text, highlights the role of easily digestible foods and the judicious use
of spices like ginger, black pepper, and cumin to enhance digestion.
Advances in science in the area of nutrition also emphasise eating
meals at proper timings, practising mindful eating, and avoiding
overeating as key factors in maintaining digestive health.

9.1.2 Do all animals digest food the same way as
humans do?
I have seen cows keep chewing
the food even when they are
not actively grazing or eating
anything. Why?

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

Birds do not have teeth,
but they have a chamber
called a gizzard (Fig. 9.7).
Food is broken down by the
contraction and relaxation
of the walls of the gizzard,
often with the help of grit
(small stones) that the birds
swallow.

Grass-eating animals, such as
cows (Fig. 9.6) and buﬀaloes,
partially chew the grass
and swallow it into their
stomachs. In the stomach,
partial digestion of the food
takes place. The partially
digested food is brought back
to the mouth for gradual
chewing. This process is
called rumination, and these
animals are called ruminants.
A cow spends about 8 hours a
day just chewing the food! The
thoroughly chewed food again
passes down the alimentary
canal for further digestion.

Fig. 9.7: Digestive system in birds

This shows that animals exhibit variations in the structure
and function of the alimentary canal to adapt to diﬀerent ways
of digesting diﬀerent kinds of food.
We have learnt that the nutrients from digested food are
carried to diﬀerent parts of the body. Some of the nutrients help
build and repair the body, while others, like sugar, are broken
down inside the body to release energy. The process by which
nutrients are converted into usable energy is called respiration.
Let us now explore how this process occurs in animals.

9.2 Respiration in Animals
We learnt in Grade 6 chapter ‘Living Creatures: Exploring their
Characteristics’, that all living beings respire. Is the process of
respiration the same in all animals? Let us ﬁrst understand the
process of respiration in humans.

129
You know that we breathe in (inhale) and breathe out (exhale) air
continuously to obtain oxygen and release carbon dioxide. How
is this oxygen used in the body? Are breathing and respiration
diﬀerent? Let us ﬁnd out.
How do we breathe?

The process of inhaling and exhaling air is called breathing. It is
diﬃcult to live without food for a week; without water for a day or
two, but without breathing, we usually cannot survive more than a
few minutes. Why is that? All of us are alive because we breathe. Not
just humans, plants and other animals also breathe. But how do we
breathe?
Just as food follows a speciﬁc pathway in the digestive system,
our body also has a speciﬁc system for breathing and respiration.
This system is called respiratory system. The respiratory
system consists of various parts as shown in Fig. 9.8. In this
system, the exchange of gases follows a speciﬁc pathway. The
pathway through which the air is inhaled and exhaled involves
various parts of the respiratory system assisting in the process of
breathing and respiration.
The respiratory system begins with a pair
of nasal openings called nostrils through
which we inhale and exhale air (Fig. 9.8).
Nostrils
The inhaled air passes into a pair of small
passages called the nasal passages. Have
Windpipe
you noticed tiny hair inside your nostrils?
Alveoli
These hair, along with mucus, help trap
Left lung
dust and dirt from the air we breathe in.
Right lung
This is why we should breathe through the
nose and not through the mouth. From the Rib cage
nasal passages, the air reaches our lungs Diaphragm
through the windpipe. The windpipe forms
Fig. 9.8: Human respiratory system
two branches, which enter the two lungs.
In the lungs, these branches further divide into smaller and
ﬁner branches that end in small balloon-like sacs called alveoli
(Fig. 9.8). Our lungs are protected by the rib cage.

9.2.1 Respiration in humans

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY

While a lot of the dust is ﬁltered out from the inhaled air, often
small infectious particles can get through the lungs. For example,
during the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 virus aﬀected
the respiratory system, leading to breathing diﬃculties and
often causing serious lung problems.

Let us understand the mechanism of breathing by making a
simple model.

 Make a hole in the lid of the bottle.
 Take a Y-shaped hollow tube, as

tightly using a large rubber band.

Pull the rubber sheet from the centre of the base downwards
and watch the balloons (Fig. 9.9a). What do you observe? Now,
release the rubber sheet upwards and observe the balloons
(Fig. 9.9b). What changes do you see in the balloons? When you
pull the rubber sheet downwards, the balloons inﬂate. Conversely,
when you release the rubber sheet upwards, the balloons deﬂate.

Breathing Practices for a Healthy Life
Breathing exercises have been practised across diﬀerent cultures
in India and worldwide for centuries. Pranayama is well known for
improving respiratory health, mind relaxation, and concentration.
In Ladakh, people practise Tummo breathing,
a technique that improves lung function and
helps keep the body warm even in cold weather.
Similarly, deep breathing techniques are used to
promote well-being. Some traditions combine deep
breathing with chanting, using rhythmic breath
control to enhance relaxation and mental clarity.

What do we breathe out?
Activity 9.3: Let us explore
To be demonstrated by the teacher
 Take an equal amount of freshly
prepared lime water in two
test tubes, A and B, as given in
Fig. 9.11.
 In test tube A, pass the air using
a syringe/pichkari (Fig. 9.11a).
This is the same air that you
inhale.
 In test tube B, repeatedly blow
air through your mouth into
the lime water using a straw
(Fig. 9.11b).

 Do you observe any changes in the colour of the lime water?
The lime water in test tube B turns milky (or cloudy), but the lime
water in test tube A does not. What does this indicate? Lime water
turns milky when it reacts with carbon dioxide. Therefore, this
indicates that the exhaled air contains more carbon dioxide than
the air we inhale.

How does the exchange of gases
happen?

Through the process of breathing,
fresh air from outside enters the

tubes containing blood (Fig. 9.12).
Blood carries carbon dioxide from
the body to the alveoli, where it is

time, oxygen from the alveoli passes
Fig. 9.12: Gas exchange through alveoli
into the blood and is transported to
all parts of the body.
Have you ever wondered how the food you eat gives you
energy? The key is not only the food but also the oxygen we
breathe! When we eat food, our body breaks it down into simple
substances like sugar (glucose). Oxygen helps break down glucose
to release energy. This process is called respiration. The word
equation of the process of respiration is as follows—

Alveoli

that
each
segment of our body gets oxygen to produce energy and remove
waste products. In simple words, breathing brings in oxygen and
removes carbon dioxide, while respiration uses oxygen to break
down food and release energy. This energy helps us walk, run,
play, and even think!
Breathing is a physical process, while respiration is a chemical
process that occurs inside the body. Both the processes are
essential for our survival!

Our body has a unique system for the transport of nutrients,
oxygen, and other substances. This system is called the circulatory
system. It includes the heart, blood, and blood vessels. The heart
pumps blood through blood vessels, ensuring the transport of
nutrients, oxygen, and other substances to all parts of the body,
while waste products are carried away.

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY

Smoking is extremely harmful to health. It damages the lungs and
increases the risk of serious diseases, including lung cancer and
other respiratory illnesses. It leads to persistent coughing and
frequent infections.
In addition to harming the smoker, smoking releases toxic
chemicals into the air, putting others at risk. When non-smokers
inhale this polluted air, they experience passive smoking, which
can be especially dangerous for children, pregnant women, and
the elderly. Due to these risks, avoiding smoking helps protect both
personal health and the well-being of those around us.

9.2.2 Do other animals breathe the same way as
humans do?
You have learnt that diﬀerent animals
Gills
live in diﬀerent habitats. You may have
observed birds ﬂying and ﬁsh swimming.
How do they breathe? Animals, such
as birds, elephants, lions, cows, goats,
lizards, and snakes, breathe through
their lungs. Although all these animals
have lungs, the structure of their lungs
are quite diﬀerent. Most aquatic animals
like ﬁsh, have specialised structures Fig. 9.14: Breathing body parts in a ﬁsh
known as gills (Fig. 9.14). These are
richly supplied with blood vessels. The exchange of oxygen and
carbon dioxide between the blood and the gases dissolved in
water takes place across the gills.
Amphibians, like frogs, live both on land and in water. They
use diﬀerent body parts for breathing at various stages of their
life. For example, tadpoles breathe through gills, while adult frogs
use lungs for breathing on land and skin for gas exchange when
they stay in water. This adaptation helps them survive both in
water and on land, showing how animals have adapted over time
to diﬀerent environments. Earthworms use their moist skin for
the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

Thus, diﬀerent animals have diﬀerent breathing mechanisms
to suit their unique habitats. Apart from the digestive system, the
respiratory system, and the circulatory system, there are other
systems which work in coordination with each other in the body
and perform diﬀerent functions to sustain life. You will study
about them in higher grades.

In a Nutshell

 Life processes such as nutrition, circulation, respiration,
excretion, and reproduction are essential for the survival
of living beings. These processes are collectively called life
processes.
 The human digestive system consists of an alimentary canal
which includes the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small
intestine, large intestine, and anus, and its associated parts,
the liver and the pancreas.
 The digested food is primarily absorbed through the walls of
the small intestine.
 The nutrients absorbed are distributed through the blood
to diﬀerent parts of the body where they are used for
performing various functions.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

 The large intestine absorbs most of the remaining water and
some salts from the undigested food.
 Grass-eating animals such as cows and goats are called
ruminants. They chew the food partially and swallow it.
Later, the partially digested food is returned to the mouth,
and the animal chews it thoroughly.
 Breathing involves the movement of air into the lungs
(inhalation) and out of the lungs (exhalation).
 The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs in the
alveoli of the lungs.
 Respiration uses oxygen from inhaled air to break down
glucose into carbon dioxide and water. The process by which
nutrients are converted into usable energy is called respiration.
 The circulatory system transports nutrients and oxygen to
all parts of the body. It includes the heart, which pumps
blood through blood vessels, delivering oxygen and nutrients
while also removing waste from the body.
 Breathing is a physical process and respiration is a chemical
process.
 Diﬀerent animals have diﬀerent breathing mechanisms
adapted to suit their habitats.
