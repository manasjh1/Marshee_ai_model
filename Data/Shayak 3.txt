Measurement of
Time and Motion

Prerna and her younger sister are watching a sports channel
on television. Prerna enjoys running and she has been declared
the fastest runner among the girls in her district for winning
the 100 metre sprint at an interschool competition held at the
district level. She is now training to compete at the state level.
She dreams of representing India at the international level in 100
metre sprint contests in future.
While watching the rerun of sprints at the Olympic games held
in the past, Prerna is always amazed that the measurement of
the time taken for the race is so advanced that they could identify
the winner even when two sprinters seemed to cross the ﬁnish
line almost together. However, in her school, the sports teacher
only used a special kind of watch called a ‘stopwatch’ for timing
the school races. She had noticed her mother wearing a watch on
her wrist and her sister looking at her mobile phone when she
needed to check the time. Her uncle used a Braille watch and had
recently acquired a talking watch that announced the time at the
touch of a button. There was also a large clock on the wall near
the school entrance. Her thoughts turned to people in the ancient
past, who did not have the modern gadgets we have today and
she wondered…
How

time
measured when there
were no clocks and
watches?

8.1 Measurement of Time

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

Humans got interested in keeping track of time long ago. They
started noticing that many events in nature repeat themselves
after deﬁnite intervals of time. For example, the rising and setting
of the Sun, the phases of the Moon and the changing seasons.
They started using the cycles of these events for timekeeping.
First, they devised calendars. A day was deﬁned by the cycle of
rising and setting of the Sun. Then began the quest to ﬁnd ways
of knowing the time of day.
So, they made many devices which
helped them to measure smaller intervals
of time within a day. Some of these were
sundials, water clocks, hourglasses, and
candle clocks.
In a sundial, time is determined with
the changing position of the shadow of an
object cast by the light of the Sun during
Fig. 8.1 A sundial
the day (Fig. 8.1).
The water clocks used the ﬂow of water
out or into a vessel to measure time. In
one type, water ﬂowed out from a vessel
which had markings for time (Fig. 8.2a). In
the other type, there would be a bowl, with
a ﬁne hole at the bottom, which was
ﬂoated on the surface of water (Fig. 8.2b).

It gradually ﬁlled up in a ﬁxed time and
Fig. 8.2 A water clock (a) Water flowing out-type
ﬁnally sank. Then, it was lifted up and
(b) Floating bowl-type
ﬂoated again.
In an hourglass (Fig. 8.3), time was
measured on the basis of the ﬂow of sand
from one bulb to another.
Candle clocks (Fig. 8.4) were candles
with markings that indicated the passage
of time when burned.

The world’s largest stone sundial,
the Samrat Yantra, was built
around 300 years ago at the Jantar
Mantar, in Jaipur, Rajasthan,
a UNESCO World Heritage site
that houses several astronomical
instruments. With its imposing
height of 27 metres, its shadow
moves at about 1 millimetre per
second and falls on a scale ﬁnely marked to measure time intervals as
short as 2 seconds. Like any sundial, it measures local or ‘solar time’,
requiring a correction to determine Indian Standard Time.

FASCINATING FACTS

In ancient India, time was measured using both shadows and water
clocks. The earliest reference to shadow-based time measurement
appears in the Arthasastra by Kautilya (was composed and revised
between the second century BCE – third century CE). An accurate
expression for time in terms of the shadow of a vertical stick was
given by Varahamihira around 530 CE. The water clock with water
ﬂowing out was described in the Arthasastra, Sardulakarnavadana,
and some other texts (early CE centuries). These clocks were not very
accurate because as water levels dropped, the ﬂow rate decreased.
This led to the development of the sinking bowl water clock
(Fig. 8.2b), or Ghatika-yantra,, ﬁrst mentioned by Aryabhata, and then
in several astronomical texts later. Time was measured constantly
with Ghatika-yantra at Buddhist monasteries, royal palaces, town
squares, and each time the bowl sank, it was announced by drums,
conch shells, or striking a gong. Though the Ghatika-yantra was
progressively replaced by pendulum clocks in the late nineteenth
century, it continued to be used at the religious places for rituals.

Pendulum
Fig. 8.6: Huygens’
Pendulum clock

As human civilisation advanced, and
as people began to travel long distances,
the measurement of time became very
critical. This led to the development of
increasingly better mechanical devices
for the measurement of time, driven
by weights, gears, and springs from the
fourteenth century onwards. However,
the invention of the pendulum clock
in the seventeenth century marked
a major breakthrough in mechanical
timekeeping.

KNOW A SCIENTIST

The pendulum clock was invented in 1656 and patented in 1657 by
Christiaan Huygens (1629 –1695). He was inspired by the investigations
of pendulums by Galileo Galilei (1564 –1642). It is said that once while
sitting in a church, Galileo’s attention was drawn to a lamp suspended
from the ceiling, which was swinging back and forth. Using his pulse
to measure time, Galileo found that the lamp took the same time for
each swing. After experimenting with diﬀerent pendulums, Galileo
concluded that the time taken to complete one oscillation was always
the same for a pendulum of a given length.

109

pendulum
consists of a small
metallic ball (called the
bob of the pendulum)
suspended from a rigid
support by a long thread
as shown in Fig. 8.7a.

We did an activity in the chapter
‘Measurement of Length and Motion’
in the Grade 6 Science textbook
Curiosity, where we observed the
oscillatory motion of an eraser hung
with a thread. Is the pendulum
similar to that?

The pendulum at rest is in its mean position. When the bob of
the pendulum is moved slightly to one side and released, it starts
oscillatory motion. Its motion is periodic in nature because it
repeats its path after a ﬁxed interval of time.
The pendulum is said to have completed one oscillation when
its bob, starting from its mean position O, moves to extreme
position A, changes direction and moves to another extreme
position B, changes direction and comes back to O (Fig. 8.7b). The
pendulum also completes one oscillation when its bob moves
from one extreme position A to another extreme position B and
comes back to A. The time taken by the pendulum to complete
one oscillation is called its time period. Let us now set up a
pendulum and measure its time period.

Activity 8.2: Let us experiment
 Collect a piece of string around 150 cm long, a heavy metal
ball with hook/ a stone (bob), a stopwatch/ watch, and a ruler.
 Tie the bob at one end of the string.
 Fix the other end of the string to a rigid support such that the
length of the string in between support and bob is around
100 cm.
 Wait for the bob to come to rest. Your pendulum is now
ready.

 Gently hold the bob, move it slightly to one side and release
it. Take care not to push the bob while releasing it and that
the string is taut. Is your pendulum now oscillating?
 Using a watch, measure the time it takes for the pendulum
to complete 10 oscillations. Record the time in Table 8.1.
 Repeat this activity 3–4 times.
 Divide the time taken for 10 oscillations by 10 to calculate
the time period of your pendulum. Note it down in Table 8.1.

Is the time period of your pendulum almost the same every
time? What do you conclude from this observation? The time
period of the pendulum is almost the same every time.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

THINK LIKE A SCIENTIST!

You just did an important historical experiment which was ﬁrst done
by Galileo, except you used a watch to measure time in place of your
pulse beat. Suppose you were Galileo experimenting with pendulums,
what all would you investigate? What questions could you ask? Would
all pendulums have the same time period? How would you test this?
Repeat Activity 8.2 using the same bob but with pendulums of two
or three diﬀerent lengths. Does the time period change? If so, how does
the length aﬀect it? If changing the length inﬂuences the time period,
does the bob’s mass also matter? Test this by repeating Activity 8.2
with a ﬁxed pendulum length but with bobs of diﬀerent mass. Do you
observe any change?
The time period of a simple pendulum depends on its length but
not on the bob’s mass. All pendulums of the same length have the same
time period at a given location.

The time period of a simple pendulum of a given length is
constant at a place. This property is used in the measurement of
time.

All clocks, old or modern, are based on some process repeating
continuously, which can be used to mark equal intervals of time.
Modern clocks measure time using the same basic principle —
periodically repeating processes — but use tiny and very rapid
vibrations either from a quartz crystal (quartz clocks) or from some
speciﬁc atoms (atomic clocks). While Huygens’ early pendulum
clocks could gain or lose 10 seconds each day, today’s atomic clocks
are so precise that they lose only one second in millions of years!
Scientists are constantly searching for even better ways to measure
time with greater accuracy.

The hole in the bowl of Ghatika-yantra was made in such a manner
that it took 24 minutes to ﬁll and sink. The time unit measured by this
clock was called ghatika or ghati. It became the standard unit of time
measurement and continued until the end of the nineteenth century.
A 24-hour-long day was, thus, divided into 60 equal ghatis.

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

In today’s world, measuring tiny fractions of a second is very
important! For example, in sports, timekeeping devices can
record events down to one-hundredth or even one-thousandth of
a second (a millisecond) to determine the winners in a race. In
medicine, heart monitors like Electrocardiogram (ECG) machines
measure the millisecond variations in heartbeats to detect health
issues. In music, digital recordings capture sound thousands of
times per second for smooth playback. Many devices use even
shorter intervals, smartphones, and computers process signals
in microseconds (one-millionth of a second), allowing them
to operate very fast. Scientists continue to develop even more
precise time-measuring tools for space exploration, medicine, and
advanced science experiments. The faster and more accurate our
clocks become, the more they help society in ways we may not
even notice!

For races covering the same
distance, we can tell who was
faster by measuring time. But how
can we tell that when comparing
races for diﬀerent distances?

8.2 Slow or Fast
What do we mean when we say something is moving fast or
slow? Suppose you are watching a 100 metre race on a straight
track. All the players begin from the starting line together but
after sometime they are not running together (Fig. 8.10). How do
you decide who is running faster amongst them?

Fig. 8.10: Boys running a race on a straight track

Measurement of Time and Motion


Someone who is ahead of others at some instant of time, is
running faster than them. Hence, someone who has covered
more distance within the same time is running faster.
The distances moved by objects in a given interval of time
decide which one is faster or slower. We often say that the faster
runner has a higher speed. You are probably familiar with the
word ‘speed’.

8.3 Speed
By comparing the distances moved by two or more objects in a
unit time, it can be found out which of them is moving faster. The
unit time may be one second or one minute or one hour. We call
the distance covered by an object in a unit time as the speed of
the object.
How can we determine the speed of an object? It can be
calculated, if we know the total distance covered by an object
and the time taken to cover it. The speed of an object is the total
distance covered divided by the total time taken to cover it. Thus,
Speed =

Total distance covered
Total time taken

What would be the unit of speed? We know the SI units of
length and time. Since the speed is distance/time, the SI unit of
speed is metre/second and is expressed as m/s.
Speed can also be expressed in other units. If we express the
distance in kilometre and time in hour, then the unit of speed is
kilometre/hour, expressed as km/h.

Example 8.1: Swati’s school is 3.6 km from her house. It took her
15 min to reach her school riding on her bicycle. Calculate the
speed of the bicycle in m/s.

Solution: Speed of the bicycle =

 Identify a train stopping at the railway station nearest to
your place of stay.
 Find out the name of the next station where this train stops.
Also, ﬁnd the distance to that station as given in the timetable.
 Note the time at which the train departs from your station and
arrives at the next station. Find the diﬀerence to calculate the
time taken by the train to cover the distance till the next station.
 Calculate the speed of the train between the two stations and
record it in Table 8.2.
 Repeat for 4–5 diﬀerent types of trains (Passenger/ Express/
Superfast).

8.3.1 Relationship between speed, distance,
and time
We already know how to calculate speed using
Speed =

Total distance covered
Total time taken

if the distance travelled and time taken for it are known to us.
We can write this equation in a diﬀerent form to calculate the
distance covered by an object, if we know its speed and the time
taken, by using

Measurement of Time and Motion

 Compare the speeds of the trains. Which is the fastest train?

Total distance covered = Speed × Total time taken
Similarly, we can also calculate the time an object will take to
cover a distance, if the distance and speed are given, by using
Total time taken =

Total distance covered

Speed
Example 8.2: Raghav is going to a neighbouring city in a bus
moving at a speed of 50 km/h. If it takes him 2 h to reach that
city, how far is that city?
Solution: Distance covered by bus = Speed × Time
= 50

km
×2h
h

= 100 km

Example 8.3: A train is travelling at a speed of 90 km/h. How
much time will it take to cover a distance of 360 km?
Solution: Time taken by the train =
=

Distance covered
Speed
360 km

90
h

=4h
In all the examples so far, we have found the speed of an
object by using ‘the total distance covered divided by the total
time taken’. However, the object might not have travelled with
the same speed during the entire duration of time. The object
might have sometimes moved slower or sometimes faster. So, the
speed that we have calculated is the average speed, but, in this
book, we have used the term ‘speed’ for ‘average speed’.

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY

Vehicles
such
as
scooters,
motorbikes, cars, and buses have
an instrument which measures and
displays the vehicle’s speed in km/h.
It is called a speedometer. Another
instrument, known as an odometer,
is also ﬁtted in the vehicles that
measures the distance travelled by
the vehicle in kilometre.

while some people would speed up or slow down.

8.4 Uniform and Non-uniform Linear Motion
Do you remember learning about linear motion in the chapter
‘Measurement of Length and Motion’ in the Grade 6 Science
textbook Curiosity? When an object moves along a straight line,
its motion is called linear motion. Now, imagine a train on a
track which is along a straight line between two adjacent railway
stations. So, the motion of the train between these two stations is
an example of linear motion (Fig. 8.11). The train starts from the
ﬁrst station A at a slow speed, then moves at a faster speed, then
slows down and comes to a halt at the next station D. In between
the two stations, for some distance (B to C), the train moves at a
constant speed, that is, at an unchanging speed.

A

B

C

D

Fig. 8.11: A train on a straight track


An object moving along a straight line with a constant speed
is said to be in uniform linear motion. So, the train is in uniform
motion between B and C (Fig. 8.11). On the other hand, if the speed
of an object moving along a straight line keeps changing, it is said
to be in non-uniform linear motion. The motion of the train
between A and B, as well as between C and D, is non-uniform
(Fig. 8.11).
An object in uniform linear motion covers equal distances
in equal intervals of time, while it covers unequal distances in
equal intervals of times when it is in non-uniform linear motion.
In Table 8.3, data are given for the distances travelled by two
trains, X and Y, between the time 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM.

Which of the two trains is in uniform linear motion between
10:00 AM and 11:00 AM? Train X covers equal distances in equal
intervals of time, so it is in uniform linear motion while Train Y
is in non-uniform linear motion.
Uniform linear motion is an idealisation. In everyday life,
we seldom ﬁnd objects moving with a constant speed over long
distances or for long intervals of time. That is why we have to use
average speeds.

Time started when our Universe was created and will

can only measure its passage in terms of a time interval
between events. These time intervals can be fractions of
a second, or even days or months, or years or centuries.
We can only say when an event occurred or for how
long it lasted. Though we have learnt to measure time
with increasing accuracy, and our lives are governed
