Light: Shadows and
Reflections

In the Western Ghat region of Maharashtra, Keshav spends
part of his summer vacation at his friend Jatin’s grandparents’
village. Having lived in a big city, he ﬁnds the forests, fresh
air, sounds of gushing streams, and chirping birds a novel
experience.
However, for Keshav, the most fascinating sight is the
dance of hundreds of ﬁreﬂies at night, ﬂashing their lights
in a wonderful performance. Jatin’s grandparents explain
that ﬁreﬂies are seasonal insects and they use light to
communicate. Unfortunately, Keshav also learns the number
of ﬁreﬂies is decreasing due to light pollution, reduced forest
cover, and excessive tourism.
At the end of their vacation, Keshav and Jatin board an
evening bus back to their city. As the bus winds through the
hilly roads, Keshav watches the moonlit landscape and the
beams from the headlights of passing vehicles ﬂashing by. He
is reminded of the many poems and songs about moonlight,
and wonders — does the Moon actually produce its own
light? Did we not learn in the chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the
Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity that all other objects in
our solar system shine only by reﬂecting the light of the
Sun? Is moonlight just reﬂected sunlight? Which objects give
oﬀ their own light? While thinking, he notices something
strange — light seems to move in a straight line!


11.1 Sources of Light

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

The Sun gives out or emits its own light and is the main source
of natural light on the Earth. Stars, lightning, natural ﬁre, and
certain animals also emit their own light (Fig. 11.1).
In ancient times, humans learnt to create
ﬁre — the earliest form of artiﬁcial lighting. With
time, they learnt to create
ﬁre using diﬀerent fuels,
such as animal fat, oil,
wax, and gas (Fig. 11.2).
With the invention of
electricity and diﬀerent
kinds of electric light
sources, most of the
lighting needs of humans
are now met by electric
Fig. 11.1: Some natural sources of light lighting (Fig. 11.3).
Objects that emit their own light are
called luminous objects. Objects that
do not emit their own light are called
non-luminous objects. The Moon is a
non-luminous object. It does not emit its
own light. It just reﬂects the light emitted

by the Sun that falls on it.
of artiﬁcial light

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY

Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamps are modern light
sources that consume much less power, are brighter
and last longer than traditional lamps. This not
only reduces electricity bills but is also better for
environment. Recognising their advantages, the
Indian government has made substantial eﬀorts to
promote the use of LED lamps nationwide. At their
end of life, LED lamps must be appropriately disposed
or recycled, and not thrown in the garbage.


Let us do an activity to try to ﬁnd out.

Screen

Activity 11.1: Let us investigate

Light: Shadows and Reﬂections

11.2 Does Light Travel in a Straight Line?
Hole

 Take three matchboxes and make a hole in
the inner tray of each matchbox, exactly at the
same position.
 Arrange these three matchboxes in a straight
line. Make sure that all three holes are exactly
at the same height and are in a line as shown
Fig. 11.4: Matchbox activity—
light through holes
in Fig. 11.4.
 Place a torch light on one side of the matchboxes, ensuring
that its lamp is at the height of the holes.
 Place a cardboard (screen) on the other side of the matchboxes
and obtain a bright spot on it. (You may need to slightly adjust
the heights of boxes.)
 Move one of the matchboxes slightly to a side or up and down.
Are you able to obtain the light spot on the screen now?
When all the three holes are not in the same line, we could not
obtain the light spot on the screen. These observations suggest
that light travels in a straight line.
Can we somehow
check it in some
other way?

I have an idea. Let us try
to see the candle ﬂame
through a bent pipe!

Should we also try out this idea?

Activity 11.2: Let us explore
Caution — Use a lighted candle under adult supervision
only.

 Take a long hollow pipe of some ﬂexible
material and align it so that you can see the
candle ﬂame as shown in Fig. 11.5a.

(a)

 Now, bend the pipe and try to see the candle
ﬂame again (Fig. 11.5b). Can you still see it?
You could see the candle ﬂame through a straight
pipe but not through a bent pipe. This shows that
light travels in a straight line.

(b)

(a) a straight pipe (b) a bent pipe

Caution — Use a laser only under teachers’ supervision. Avoid
using high-power lasers for this activity; a low-power laser
pointer is suﬃcient. Never point the laser beam directly at
anyone’s eyes, as it can cause serious eye damage.

EEPER
DIVE

Pass a laser beam
through a beaker ﬁlled with
water in which a drop of
milk is added to make the
laser beam easily visible.
What do you observe? Do you see that the
beam of laser light inside water follows a
straight path?
However, light can sometimes even bend
around corners! This is something you will
learn in the higher grades.

11.3 Light through Transparent,
Translucent, and Opaque Materials
What happens when an object
comes in the path of light?

Let us place objects made of
diﬀerent materials in the path of
light and ﬁnd out.

Activity 11.3: Let us experiment

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

 Collect objects made of diﬀerent materials. Also, you will
need a torch.

 List the materials of the objects in Table 11.1 and classify them
into transparent, translucent, and opaque (In the chapter
‘Materials Around Us’ in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity
you learnt to classify materials into transparent,
translucent, and opaque, depending on how
you could see through them).
 Go to a dark room, turn on the torch, and place
it at such a position that you get a spot of light
from the torch on a wall. Or you may place a
cardboard screen as shown in Fig. 11.6 and get
the spot of light on it.
Fig. 11.6: Passing light
 We will now conduct this activity in two
through different materials
parts — prediction and observation.

Predict what will happen if you hold an object in front of
the light coming out of the torch. Would you continue to
see the spot of light on the screen? Note your prediction
in Table 11.1.

Now, actually place the object between the torch and
the screen. Does light pass through the object? Note your
observation in Table 11.1.
 Repeat this for all the objects.
Was your observation the same as your prediction? What
conclusions could you draw? Light passes almost completely
through transparent materials. Light passes partially through
translucent materials. Light does not pass through opaque
materials.

Light: Shadows and Reﬂections


What happens when an
opaque object blocks
the path of light?

11.4 Shadow Formation
What did you see on the screen in Activity 11.3 when
an opaque object was placed in the path of light? Did
you see a dark patch on the wall? Why was this dark
patch formed?
We now know that light travels in a straight line.
So, when an opaque object is placed in its path, light is
blocked. The dark patch, where light does not reach,
is the shadow.

Fig. 11.7: Shadows around us
We have noticed shadows of ourselves and other objects
around us when we are in the Sun or under a light (Fig. 11.7).
Also, you might have had fun making diﬀerent shapes with
shadows sometime.
Do translucent and transparent objects create shadows or not?
Did you notice that in Activity 11.3? Opaque objects form darker
shadows. Translucent objects make lighter shadows. Even some
transparent objects can create faint shadows!
Let us learn more about shadows.

Activity 11.4: Let us explore
 Collect some opaque objects of diﬀerent shapes and sizes.
 Repeat Activity 11.3, but this time, carry out the actions
mentioned in the ﬁrst column of Table 11.2.
 Observe the shape and size of the shadow on the screen for
each of the actions.
Did the shadow form in all cases? Was the shape and size of the
shadow the same as the object?
 Record your observations in the second column of Table 11.2.

The screen is removed.

The object is removed.
The torch is switched oﬀ.
The object is moved closer to the screen,
keeping the torch and the screen ﬁxed.
The object is moved closer to the torch,
keeping the torch and the screen ﬁxed.
The object is tilted, keeping the torch and
the screen ﬁxed.
The colour of the object is changed.

What conclusions do you draw from this activity? What do
we need to observe a shadow? Does the colour of the shadow
change when the colour of the object is changed?
Shadows are formed when an object blocks light from falling on
a screen. We need a source of light, an opaque object, and a screen

to observe a shadow. The walls, ﬂoor, ground, or any other surface
acts as a screen for observing shadows in our daily life.
The shape, size, and sharpness of the shadow depend on the
position of the object relative to the light source and the screen.
The shadows may give information about the object or we may
not be able to guess the object at all. Changing the colour of
opaque objects does not change the colour of the shadows.

FASCINATING FACTS

Shadow play, or shadow puppetry,
has been a part of our cultural
heritage for centuries. In this art
form, ﬂat cut-out ﬁgures called
shadow puppets are placed between
a light source and a screen. By
moving the puppets and the light,
puppeteers can create life-like
movements, bringing the characters
to life. Diﬀerent regions have their
own unique styles, like the Charma
Bahuli Natya in Maharashtra, Keelu
Bomme and Tholu Bommalata of Andhra Pradesh, Togalu Gombeyaata
in Karnataka, Ravana Chhaya in Odisha, Tholpavakoothu in Kerala, and
Bommalattam in Tamil Nadu. These are used not only for entertainment
but also communicate important messages to the community.

Light: Shadows and Reﬂections


11.5 Reﬂection of Light
When the opaque object was a shiny object like a
polished steel plate, I got a shadow on the screen,
but I also saw that there was a bright spot of light
on the wall on the opposite side. Why was it so?

Activity 11.5: Let us investigate
 Find a shiny ﬂat steel plate or a plane mirror, that is, a mirror
that is ﬂat and not curved.
 Take it outside and let the sunlight fall on the shiny surface.
What can you do to redirect light on the wall on which the
sunlight is not falling directly?

 Turn the shiny plate or mirror in
diﬀerent directions to redirect the
light onto a wall or a nearby surface
(Fig. 11.8). Do you see a spot of light
on the wall? Does it mean that the
shiny plate or mirror has changed
the direction of light?

Fig. 11.8: Using mirror to redirect
sunlight on a wall

 Now, tilt the shiny plate or mirror
in diﬀerent ways and observe
the light spot on the wall. Does it
change position? Notice how light
always travels in straight lines and
changes direction when it falls on
the shiny plate or mirror.

What conclusion do you draw from your observations? This
activity suggests that a shiny surface or a mirror changes the
direction of light that falls upon it. This change in direction of
light by a mirror is called the reﬂection of light. Let us try to
understand the reﬂection of light by a mirror.

Activity 11.6: Let us experiment
Thin slit

 Take a plane mirror with stand, a torch, a comb,
a sheet of white paper, and a strip of black paper.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

 Using the black paper, close all openings of the
comb, except for one to make a thin slit.

(a)
Plane mirror

 Spread a white paper on a table, hold the comb
perpendicular to the sheet of paper and shine
the torch light on the slit. Adjust the comb and
torch slightly till you see a thin beam of light
along the paper which has passed through the
slit (Fig. 11.9a).
 Now, place the mirror in the path of the light
beam while keeping the comb steady (Fig. 11.9b).
What do you observe?
The path of the light beam is changed after falling
on the mirror. The reﬂection of light occurs at the
mirror.

(b)
Fig. 11.9: (a) A light beam (b) Reﬂection
of light in a plane mirror

In a mirror, I can also see my
face. Is that also due to the
reﬂection of light?


11.6 Images Formed in a Plane Mirror
Light: Shadows and Reﬂections

Look into the mirror. Do you see your face in it? What you see is
a reﬂection of your face in the mirror. We also see reﬂections of
other objects that are in front of the mirror. Let us try to ﬁnd out
more about this.

Activity 11.7: Let us experiment
 Take a plane mirror and a pen or some other object.
 Place the pen in front of the mirror as shown in
Fig. 11.10.
What do you see in the mirror? It appears as if a similar
pen is placed behind the mirror. The pen which appears
Fig. 11.10: Image of a pen
behind the mirror is the image of the pen formed by the
in a plane mirror
mirror. The pen itself is the object.
 Now, move the pen to diﬀerent positions in front of the
mirror and compare the sizes of the images of the pen at
each position.
Are the two sizes the same? The image formed by a plane
mirror is of the same size as the object.
 Again, move the pen to diﬀerent positions in front of the
mirror and observe if the image is upright at each position.
Does the tip of the pen appear on top at each position? An
upright image is called erect. An image formed by a plane mirror
is erect.
 Now, place a screen vertically behind the mirror. Move it
around. Do you get the image on the screen? Repeat this by
placing the screen in front of the mirror.
The image formed by a plane mirror cannot be obtained on
a screen.

Activity 11.8: Let us experiment
 Stand in front of a plane mirror and look at your image
(Fig. 11.11). Notice how far it appears to be from the mirror.
 Now, stand close to the mirror. Is the image also closer to the
mirror?
 Stand at diﬀerent distances from the mirror and notice how
far the image appears to be from the mirror in each case.
Do you ﬁnd any relation between your distance from the Fig. 11.11: Observing one’s
mirror and the distance of your image from the mirror?
own image in a mirror

You might have noticed that when you stand close to the
plane mirror, the image also appears to be close to the mirror.
The image appears to be far from the mirror when you stand far
from the plane mirror.
 Raise your left arm. Which arm does your image raise?
 Touch your right ear. Which ear does your image touch?
You ﬁnd that your left appears right in your image and your
right appears left in your image. This type of perceived left-right
reversal is called lateral inversion. There is lateral inversion in
the images formed by a plane mirror.
Oh! Now I realise why ‘
̓ is written
on an ambulance. It reads ‘AMBULANCE ̓ when
viewed from the rear-view mirrors of the
vehicle ahead of the ambulance.

FASCINATING FACTS

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

When mirrors were invented is not known. Earlier, mirrors
were made by polishing stone or metal. When glass mirrors
started being made, the art of making metal mirrors got lost
gradually. However, it still survives, for example, in Kerala,
where Aranmula Kannadi, a unique metal surface mirror has
been made for centuries.

Can we see an image of an
object only in a mirror or are
there some other ways as well?

11.7 Pinhole Camera
A pinhole camera is a device in which the light rays from an
object pass through a tiny hole (a pinhole) and form an image on
a screen.


Screen

Caution — Use a lighted candle under adult supervision
only.

 Take a piece of cardboard and a candle. Make
a small hole in the cardboard.

 In a dimly lit room, position the cardboard at
a short distance from a screen.

(a)

 Place a lighted candle in front of it as shown
in Fig. 11.12a.
What do you see on the screen? Light coming
from the ﬂame passes through the hole on the
cardboard and forms an image of the candle ﬂame
on the screen. Do you notice anything surprising?
The image of the candle ﬂame is upside down, that
is, inverted.
Let us now make a pinhole camera, which you can
use outdoors.

Activity 11.10: Let us construct

 Take two boxes of cardboard such that one can slide
into another with very little gap in between them.
Cut open one side of each box.
 On the opposite face of the larger box, make a small
hole in the middle (Fig. 11.13a).
 On the opposite face of the smaller box, cut out a
square from the middle with a side of about 5–6 cm.
Cover this opening with a thin translucent paper
(like a tracing paper) to form a screen (Fig. 11.13b).
 Slide the smaller box inside the larger one in such
a way that the side with the tracing paper is inside
(Fig. 11.13c).
Hold the pinhole camera with the pinhole facing the
object and look through the open side of the smaller
box. Cover your head and the camera with a dark cloth.
Look at a distant object, like a tree or building, in bright
sunlight and move the smaller box forward or backward
until an image appears on the tracing paper.
Do the images seen in the camera show the colours
of the objects on the other side? Are the images erect or
upside down?

11.8 Making Some Useful Items
After having learnt that light travels in a straight line and is
reﬂected by mirrors, it is time to create some useful items based
on this learning.

11.8.1 Periscope
We can make a simple periscope by
placing two plane mirrors in a Z-shaped
box as shown in Fig. 11.14.
Reﬂection
from
two
mirrors
enables us to see objects that are not
visible directly. Periscopes are used in
submarines, tanks, or by soldiers to see
outside their bunkers. You may use it
to look ahead when standing behind
taller friends.

11.8.2 Kaleidoscope
Get three rectangular plane mirror
strips of equal width and join them
together in a triangular manner as
shown in Fig. 11.15a. You may use three
strips of thick reﬂective paper instead
of mirrors. Fix these in a circular tube
of thick chart paper (Fig. 11.15b). On
one end of the tube, ﬁx a transparent
plastic sheet using a rubber band or
an adhesive tape. Place several broken
pieces of coloured bangles or beads on
this (Fig. 11.15c), and cover it with a
tracing paper using a rubber band or
an adhesive tape.
When you peep through the open
side, you view a beautiful pattern
(Fig. 11.15d). Even if you leave both
sides of the kaleidoscope open and


Light: Shadows and Reﬂections

point it towards a tree or other objects, you see beautiful patterns.
An interesting feature of the kaleidoscope is that one always gets
to see a diﬀerent pattern every time the kaleidoscope is turned
about. Since there are 3 mirrors, and multiple images (due to
reﬂections of reﬂections), many interesting patterns are formed.
Designers and artists often use kaleidoscopes to get ideas for new
patterns.

In a Nutshell
 Objects that emit their own light are called luminous objects.
 Light travels in a straight line.
 Light passes almost completely through transparent
materials. Light passes partially through translucent
materials. Light does not pass through opaque materials.
 A shadow is formed when light is blocked by an object.
Opaque objects form darker shadows. Translucent objects
make lighter shadows. Some transparent objects can create
faint shadows.
 The change in the direction of light by a mirror is called
reﬂection of light.
 The image formed by a plane mirror is of the same size as
the object, is erect, cannot be obtained on a screen, and is
laterally inverted.
 A pinhole camera creates an inverted image of an object on
a screen.

Light emitted by the Sun takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach
the Earth. Hence, if the Sun were to suddenly stop emitting light, we
would not know that for another 8 minutes 20 seconds.
