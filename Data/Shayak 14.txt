Nutrition in Plants
n Class VI you learnt that food is
essential for all living organisms
You also learnt that carbohydrates
proteins fats vitamins and minerals are
components of food These components
of food are called nutrients and are
necessary for our body
All living organisms require food
Plants can synthesise food for
themselves but animals including
humans cannot They get it from plants
or animals that eat plants Thus
humans and animals are directly or
indirectly dependent on plants
Boojho wants to know
how plants prepare
their own food
11 MODE OF NUTRITION IN PLANTS
Plants are the only organisms that can
prepare food for themselves by using
water carbon dioxide and minerals The
raw materials are present in their
surroundings
The nutrients enable living
organisms to build their bodies to grow
to repair damaged parts of their bodies
and provide the energy to carry out life
processes Nutrition is the mode of
taking food by an organism and its
utilisation by the body The mode of
nutrition in which organisms make food
themselves from simple substances is
called autotrophic auto  self trophos
 nourishment nutrition Therefore
plants are called autotrophs Animals
and most other organisms take in food
prepared by plants They are called
heterotrophs heteros  other
Paheli wants to know why
our body cannot make food
from carbon dioxide water
and minerals like plants do
Now we may ask where the food
factories of plants are located whether
food is made in all parts of a plant or
only in certain parts How do plants
obtain the raw materials from the
surroundings How do they transport
them to the food factories of plants
12 PHOTOSYNTHESIS  FOOD
MAKING PROCESS IN PLANTS
Leaves are the food factories of plants
Therefore all the raw materials must
reach the leaf Water and minerals
present in the soil are absorbed by the
roots and transported to the leaves
Carbon dioxide from air is taken in
Cells
You have seen that buildings are made of bricks
Similarly the bodies of living organisms are
made of tiny units called cells Cells can be seen
only under the microscope Some organisms
are made of only one cell The cell is enclosed by
a thin outer boundary called the cell membrane
Most cells have a distinct centrally located
spherical structure called the nucleus Fig 11
The nucleus is surrounded by a jellylike
substance called cytoplasm
through the tiny pores present on the
surface of leaves These pores are
surrounded by guard cells Such pores
are called stomata Fig 12 c
Boojho wants to know how water
and minerals absorbed by roots
reach the leaves
Water and minerals are transported
to the leaves by the vessels which run
like pipes throughout the root the stem
the branches and the leaves They form
a continuous path or passage for the
nutrients to reach the leaf They are
called vessels You will learn more about
transport of materials in plants in
Chapter 7
Paheli wants to know what is so
special about the leaves that they
can synthesise food but other
parts of the plant cannot
Nucleus
Cytoplasm
Cell membrane
Fig 11 Cell
The leaves have a green pigment
called chlorophyll It helps leaves to
capture the energy of the sunlight This
energy is used to synthesise prepare
food from carbon dioxide and water
Since the synthesis of food occurs in the
presence of sunlight it is called
photosynthesis Photo light synthesis 
to combine So we find that chlorophyll
sunlight carbon dioxide and water are
necessary to carry out the process of
photosynthesis It is a unique process
on the earth The solar energy is
captured by the leaves and stored in the
plant in the form of food Thus sun is
the ultimate source of energy for all
living organisms
Can you imagine life on earth in the
absence of photosynthesis
In the absence of photosynthesis
there would not be any food The
survival of almost all living organisms
directly or indirectly depends upon the
food made by the plants Besides
oxygen which is essential for the survival
2
Besides leaves photosynthesis also takes place in other green parts of the
plant  in green stems and green branches The desert plants have scale or
spinelike leaves to reduce loss of water by transpiration These plants have
green stems which carry out photosynthesis
of all organisms is produced during
photosynthesis In the absence of
photosynthesis life would be impossible
on the earth
During photosynthesis chlorophyll
containing cells of leaves Fig 12 in
the presence of sunlight use carbon
dioxide and water to synthesise
carbohydrates Fig 13 The process
can be represented in an equation

Perform iodine test with the leaves of
both the plants as you did in Class VI
Record your results Now leave the pot
which was earlier kept in the dark in
the sunlight for 3  4 days and perform
the iodine test again on its leaves
Record your observations in your
notebook
The leaves other than green also have
chlorophyll The large amount of red
brown and other pigments mask the
green colour Fig 14 Photosynthesis
takes place in these leaves also
carbohydrates are made of carbon
hydrogen and oxygen These are used
to synthesise other components of food
such as proteins and fats But proteins
are nitrogenous substances which
contain nitrogen From where do the
plants obtain nitrogen
Recall that nitrogen is present in
abundance in gaseous form in the air
However plants cannot absorb nitrogen
in this form Soil has certain bacteria that
convert gaseous nitrogen into a usable
form and release it into the soil These
are absorbed by the plants along with
water Also you might have seen farmers
adding fertilisers rich in nitrogen to the
soil In this way the plants fulfil their
requirements of nitrogen along with the
other constituents Plants can then
synthesise proteins and vitamins
13 OTHER MODES OF NUTRITION IN
PLANTS
Fig 14 Leaves of various colours
You often see slimy green patches
in ponds or stagnant water bodies These
are generally formed by the growth of
organisms called algae Can you guess
why algae are green in colour They
contain chlorophyll which gives them
the green colour Algae can also prepare
their own food by photosynthesis
Synthesis of plant food other
than carbohydrates
You have just learnt that plants
synthesise carbohydrates through the
process of photosynthesis The
There are some plants which do not have
chlorophyll They cannot synthesise
food How do they survive and from
where do they derive nutrition Like
humans and animals such plants
depend on the food produced by other
plants They use the heterotrophic
mode of nutrition Look at Fig 15 Do
you see a yellow wiry branched structure
twining around the stem and branches
of a tree This is a plant called Cuscuta
Amarbel It does not have chlorophyll
It takes readymade food from the plant
on which it is climbing The plant on
which it climbs is called the host Since
it deprives the host of valuable nutrients

hair which are directed downwards
When an insect lands in the pitcher the
lid closes and the trapped insect gets
entangled into the hair The lid closes
and the insect is trapped The insect is
digested by the digestive juices secreted
in the pitcher and its nutrients are
absorbed Such insecteating plants are
called insectivorous plants
Is it possible that such plants do not
get all the required nutrients from the
soil in which they grow
Fig 15 Cuscuta Amarbel on host plant
Cuscuta is called the parasite Are we
and other animals also a kind of
parasites You should think about it
and discuss with your teacher
Boojho is confused If the
pitcher plant is green and
carries out photosynthesis then
why does it feed on insects
Lid
Paheli wants to know whether
mosquitoes bed bugs lice and
leeches that suck our blood are
also parasites
Have you seen or heard of plants that
can eat animals There are a few plants
which can trap insects and digest them
Is it not amazing Such plants may be
green or of some other colour Look at
the plant in Fig 16 The pitcherlike or
juglike structure is the modified part
of leaf The apex of the leaf forms a lid
which can open and close the mouth of
the pitcher Inside the pitcher there are

umbrellalike patches growing in moist
soils or on rotting wood during the rainy
season Fig 17 Let us find out what
type of nutrients they need to survive
and from where they get them
Fig 18 Fungi

Fig 17 Packet of mushrooms a mushroom
growing on decayed material
Boojho wants to know how
these organisms acquire
nutrients They do not have
mouths like animals do They are
not like green plants as they lack
chlorophyll and cannot make food
by photosynthesis
Activity 12
These organisms are called fungi
They have a different mode of nutrition
They absorb the nutrients from the
bread This mode of nutrition in which
organisms take in nutrients from dead
and decaying matter is called
saprotrophic nutrition Such organisms
with saprotrophic mode of nutrition are
called saprotrophs
Fungi also grow on pickles leather
clothes and other articles that are left
in hot and humid weather for long time
During the rainy season they spoil many
things Ask your parents about the
menace of fungi in your house
The fungal spores are generally
present in the air When they land on
Take a piece of bread and moisten it with
water Leave it in a moist warm place
for 23 days or until fluffy patches
appear on them Fig 18 What is the
colour of these patches Observe the
patches under a microscope or a
magnifying glass Write down your
observations in the notebook You will
see cottonlike threads spread on the
piece of bread

Paheli is keen to know
whether her beautiful shoes
which she wore on special
occasions were spoiled by fungi
during the rainy season She
wants to know how fungi appear
suddenly during the rainy
season
15 HOW NUTRIENTS ARE
REPLENISHED IN THE SOIL
Boojho says once his
grandfather told him that his
wheat fields were spoiled by a
fungus He wants to know if
fungi cause diseases also
Paheli told him that many fungi
like yeast and mushrooms are
useful but some fungi
cause diseases in plants
animals including
humans Some
fungi are also
used as medicines
wet and warm things they germinate and
grow Now can you figure out how we
can protect our things from getting
spoiled
Some organisms live together and
share both shelter and nutrients This
relationship is called symbiosis For
example certain fungi live inside the
roots of plants The plants provide
nutrients to the fungus and in return
the fungus provides water and certain
nutrients
In organisms called lichens a
chlorophyllcontaining partner which is
an alga and a fungus live together The
fungus provides shelter water and
minerals to the alga and in return the
alga prepares and provides food to the
fungus
Have you seen farmers spreading
manure or fertilisers in the fields or
gardeners using them in lawns or in
pots Do you know why this is done
You learnt that plants absorb
minerals and nutrients from the soil
So their amounts in the soil keep on
declining Fertilisers and manures
contain nutrients such as nitrogen
potassium phosphorous etc These
nutrients need to be added from time
to time to enrich the soil We can grow
plants and keep them healthy if
we can fulfil the nutrient requirement
of plants
Usually crop plants absorb a lot of
nitrogen and the soil becomes deficient
in nitrogen You learnt that though
nitrogen gas is available in plenty in the
air plants cannot use it in the manner
they can use carbon dioxide They need
nitrogen in a soluble form The
bacterium called Rhizobium can take
atmospheric nitrogen and convert it into
a usable form But Rhizobium cannot
make its own food So it often lives in
the roots of gram peas moong beans
and other legumes and provides them
with nitrogen In return the plants
provide food and shelter to the
bacteria They thus have a
symbiotic relationship This association
is of great significance for the
farmers They can reduce the use of
nitrogenous fertiliser where leguminous

In this chapter you learnt that
most of the plants are autotrophs
Only a few plants are parasitic or
saprotrophic They derive nutrition
from other organisms All animals are
categorised as heterotrophs since
they depend on plants and other
animals for food Can we say that
the insectivorous plants are partial

What you have learnt
All organisms need food and utilise it to get energy for growth and
maintenance of their body
Green plants synthesise food for themselves by the process of
photosynthesis They are autotrophs
Plants like Cuscuta are parasites They take food from the host plant
Plants use simple chemical substances like carbon dioxide water and
minerals for the synthesis of food
Chlorophyll water carbon dioxide and sunlight are the essential
requirements for photosynthesis
Complex chemical substances such as carbohydrates are the products
of photosynthesis
Solar energy is absorbed by the chlorophylls present in leavesplants
Oxygen is produced during photosynthesis
Oxygen released in photosynthesis is utilised by living organisms for
their survival
Many fungi derive nutrition from dead and decaying matter They are
saprotrophs
A few plants and all animals are dependent on others for their nutrition
and are called heterotrophs

Nutrition in Animals
ou have learnt in Chapter 1 that
plants can prepare their own food
by the process of photosynthesis
but animals cannot Animals get their
food from plants either directly by
eating plants or indirectly by eating
animals that eat plants Some animals
eat both plants and animals Recall that
all organisms including humans require
food for growth repair and functioning
of the body Animal nutrition includes
nutrient requirement mode of intake
of food and its utilisation in the body
You have studied in Class VI that food
consists of many components Try to
recall and list them below

Now pour 23 drops of iodine solution
in each test tube and observe Why is
there a change in colour in the test
tubes Discuss the results with your
classmates and your teacher The saliva
breaks down the starch into sugars
The tongue is a fleshy muscular
organ attached at the back to the floor
of the buccal cavity It is free at the front
and can be moved in all directions Do
you know the functions of the tongue
We use our tongue for talking Besides
it mixes saliva with the food during
chewing and helps in swallowing food
We also taste food with our tongue It
has taste buds that detect different
tastes of food We can find out the
Sweets and tooth decay
Normally bacteria are present in our mouth but they are not harmful
to us However if we do not clean our teeth and mouth after eating
a
many harmful bacteria also begin to live and grow in it These bacteria
break down the sugars present from the leftover food and release
acids see Chapter 4 to know what an acid is The acids gradually
damage the teeth Fig 25 This is called tooth decay If it is not b
treated in time it causes severe toothache and in extreme cases
results in tooth loss Chocolates sweets soft drinks and other sugar
products are the major culprits of tooth decay
Therefore one should clean the teeth with a brush or datun and c
dental floss a special strong thread which is moved between two
teeth to take out trapped food particles at least twice a day and
rinse the mouth after every meal Also one should not put dirty
fingers or any unwashed object in the mouth

Sometimes when you eat in a hurry talk or laugh while eating you may cough
get hiccups or a choking sensation This happens when food particles enter the
windpipe The windpipe carries air from the nostrils to the lungs It runs adjacent
to the foodpipe But inside the throat air and food share a common passage
Then how is food prevented from entering the windpipe During the act of
swallowing a flaplike valve closes the passage of the windpipe and guides the
food into the foodpipe If by chance food particles enter the windpipe we feel
choked get hiccups or cough

and the chest Food is pushed down by
movement of the wall of the foodpipe
Actually this movement takes place
throughout the alimentary canal and
pushes the food downwards Fig 27
At times the food is not accepted by our
stomach and is vomited out Recall the
instances when you vomited after eating
and think of the reason for it Discuss
with your parents and teacher
The stomach
The stomach is a thickwalled bag Its
shape is like a flattened J and it is the
widest part of the alimentary canal It
receives food from the food pipe at one
end and opens into the small intestine
at the other
The inner lining of the stomach
secretes mucous hydrochloric acid and
digestive juices The mucous protects
the lining of the stomach The acid kills
many bacteria that enter along with the
food and makes the medium in the
stomach acidic and helps the digestive
juices to act The digestive juices break
down the proteins into simpler
substances
The small intestine
The small intestine is highly coiled and
is about 75 metres long It receives
secretions from the liver and the pancreas
Besides its wall also secretes juices
The liver is a reddish brown gland
situated in the upper part of the
abdomen on the right side It is the
largest gland in the body It secretes bile
juice that is stored in a sac called the
gall bladder Fig 22 The bile plays
an important role in the digestion of fats
The pancreas is a large cream
coloured gland located just below the
stomach Fig 22 The pancreatic juice
acts on carbohydrates fats and proteins
and changes them into simpler forms
The working of the stomach was discovered by a
strange accident In 1822 a man named Alexis St
Martin was badly hit by a shot gun The bullet had
seriously damaged the chest wall and made a hole
in his stomach He was brought to an American
army doctor William Beaumont The doctor saved
the patient but he could not close the hole properly
and left it bandaged Fig 28 Beaumont took it as
a great opportunity to see the inside of the stomach
through the hole He made some wonderful
observations
Beaumont found that the stomach was churning Fig 28 Alexis St Martins
shotgun wound
food Its wall secreted a fluid which could digest
the food He also observed that the end of the stomach opens into the intestine
only after the digestion of the food inside the stomach is completed
16
The partly digested food now reaches the
lower part of the small intestine where
the intestinal juice completes the
digestion of all components of the food
The carbohydrates get broken into
simple sugars such as glucose fats into
fatty acids and glycerol and proteins
into amino acids
proteins required by the body This is
called assimilation In the cells glucose
breaks down with the help of oxygen
into carbon dioxide and water and
energy is released The food that
remains undigested and unabsorbed
enters into the large intestine
Absorption in the small
intestine
The large intestine is wider and shorter
than small intestine It is about 15 metre
in length Its function is to absorb water
and some salts from the undigested food
material The remaining waste passes
into the rectum and remains there as
semisolid faeces The faecal matter is
removed through the anus from
timetotime This is called egestion
The digested food can now pass into the
blood vessels in the wall of the intestine
This process is called absorption The
inner walls of the small intestine have
thousands of fingerlike outgrowths
These are called villi singular villus
Can you guess what the role of villi could
be in the intestine The villi increase
the surface area for absorption of the
digested food Each villus has a network
of thin and small blood vessels close to
its surface The surface of the villi
absorbs the digested food materials The
absorbed substances are transported
via the blood vessels to different organs
of the body where they are used to build
complex substances such as the
Large intestine
23 DIGESTION IN GRASSEATING
ANIMALS
Have you observed cows buffaloes
and other grasseating animals
chewing continuously even when
they are not eating Actually they
quickly swallow the grass and store
it in a part of the stomach called
rumen Fig 29 Here the food gets
Diarrhoea
Sometime you may have experienced the need to pass watery stool frequently
This condition is known as diarrhoea It may be caused by an infection food
poisoning or indigestion It is very common in India particularly among children
Under severe conditions it can be fatal This is because of the excessive loss of
water and salts from the body Diarrhoea should not be neglected Even before a
doctor is consulted the patient should be given plenty of boiled and cooled water
with a pinch of salt and sugar dissolved in it This is called Oral Rehydration

Paheli wants to know why
these animals cannot chew
food properly at the time they
take it in
Boojho wants to know why
we cannot digest cellulose
like the cattle do
partially digested and is called cud
But later the cud returns to the mouth
in small lumps and the animal chews
it This process is called rumination and
these animals are called ruminants
The grass is rich in cellulose a type
of carbohydrate In ruminants like cattle
deer etc bacteria present in rumen
Oesophagus
Small Intestine

helps in digestion of cellulose Many
animals including humans cannot
digest cellulose
Animals like horses rabbit etc have
a large saclike structure called Caecum
between the oesophagus and the small
intestine Fig 29 The cellulose of the
food is digested here by the action of
certain bacteria which are not present in
humans
So far you have learnt about animals
which possess the digestive system But
there are many small organisms which do
not have a mouth and a digestive system
Then how do they acquire and digest
food In the section below you will learn
another interesting way of food intake

Egested waste
Amoeba feeds on some microscopic
organisms When it senses food it
pushes out pseudopodia around the
food particle and engulfs it The food
becomes trapped in a food vacuole
Fig 210
Digestive juices are secreted into the
food vacuole They act on the food and
break it down into simpler substances
Gradually the digested food is absorbed
The absorbed substances are used for
growth maintenance and multiplication
The undigested residue of the food is
expelled outside by the vacuole
The basic process of digestion of
food and release of energy is the same
in all animals In a later chapter you
will learn about the transport of food
absorbed by the intestine to the various
parts of the body

What you have learnt
Animal nutrition includes nutrient requirement mode of intake of food
and its utilisation in the body
The human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and
secretory glands It consists of the i buccal cavity ii oesophagus
iii stomach iv small intestine v large intestine ending in rectum
and vi anus The main digestive glands which secrete digestive juices
are i the salivary glands ii the liver and iii the pancreas The stomach
wall and the wall of the small intestine also secrete digestive juices
The modes of feeding vary in different organisms
Nutrition is a complex process involving i ingestion ii digestion
iii absorption iv assimilation and v egestion
NUTRITION IN ANIMALS
19
Digestion of carbohydrates like starch begins in the buccal cavity The
digestion of protein starts in the stomach The bile secreted from the
liver the pancreatic juice from the pancreas and the digestive juice
from the intestinal wall complete the digestion of all components of food
in the small intestine The digested food is absorbed in the blood vessels
from the small intestine
The absorbed substances are transported to different parts of the body
Water and some salts are absorbed from the undigested food in the
large intestine
The undigested and unabsorbed residues are expelled out of the body
as faeces through the anus
The grazing animals like cows buffaloes and deer are known as
ruminants They quickly ingest swallow their leafy food and store it in
the rumen Later the food returns to the mouth and the animal chews it
peacefully
Amoeba ingests its food with the help of its false feet or pseudopodia
The food is digested in the food vacuole

ou know that woollen clothes are
made from animal fibres You
also know that cotton clothes are
made from plant fibres We wear woollen
clothes during winters when it is cold
outside Woollen clothes keep us warm
We prefer to wear light coloured cotton
clothes when it is hot These give us a
feeling of coolness You might have
wondered why particular types of
clothes are suitable for a particular
season
In winter you feel cold inside the
house If you come out in the sun you
feel warm In summer you feel hot even
inside the house How do we know
whether an object is hot or cold How
do we find out how hot or cold an object
is In this chapter we shall try to seek
answers to some of these questions
and some of them are cold Tea is hot
and ice is cold List some objects you
use commonly in Table 31 Mark these
objects as hot or cold
Do not touch objects which are too
hot Be careful while handling a
candle flame or a stove
We see that some objects are cold
while some are hot You also know that
some objects are hotter than others
while some are colder than others How
do we decide which object is hotter than
the other We often do it by touching
the objects But is our sense of touch
reliable Let us find out
Activity 31

conclude
Fig 32 A clinical thermometer
your hand and examine it carefully If
you do not have a thermometer request
a friend to share it with you A clinical
thermometer looks like the one shown
in Fig 32
A clinical thermometer consists of a
long narrow uniform glass tube It has
a bulb at one end This bulb contains
mercury Outside the bulb a small
shining thread of mercury can be seen
If you do not see the mercury thread
rotate the thermometer a bit till you see
it You will also find a scale on the
thermometer The scale we use is the
celsius scale indicated by C
Boojhos confusion shows that we
cannot always rely on our sense of touch
to decide whether an object
is hot or cold Sometimes
Boojho wondered which of the two scales
it may deceive us
shown in Fig 32 he should read Paheli told
Then how do we find
him that India has adopted the celsius scale
out how hot an object really
and we should read that scale The other scale
is A reliable measure of the
with the range 94108 degrees is the
hotness of an object is its
Fahrenheit scale F It was in use earlier
temperature Temperature is
measured by a device called
thermometer
A clinical thermometer reads
32 MEASURING TEMPERATURE
temperature from 35C to 42C
Have you seen a thermometer Recall
that when you or someone else in your
family had fever the temperature was
measured by a thermometer The
thermometer that measures our body
temperature is called a clinical
thermometer Hold the thermometer in
Activity 32
Reading a thermometer
Let us learn how to read a thermometer
First note the temperature difference
indicated between the two bigger marks
Also note down the number of divisions
HEAT
25
Precautions to be observed while using a clinical thermometer
 Thermometer should be washed before and after use preferably with an
antiseptic solution
 Ensure that before use the mercury level is below 35C
 Read the thermometer keeping the level of mercury along the line of sight
See Fig 33
 Handle the thermometer with care If it hits against some hard object it can
break
 Dont hold the thermometer by the bulb while reading it
shown by smaller marks between these
marks Suppose the bigger marks read
one degree and there are five divisions
between them Then one small division
can read
1
 02 C 
5
Wash the thermometer preferably
with an antiseptic solution Hold it
firmly and give it a few jerks The jerks
will bring the level of mercury down
Ensure that it falls below 35C Now
place the bulb of the thermometer
under your tongue After one minute
take the thermometer out and note the
reading This is your body temperature
The temperature should always be
stated with its unit C
What did you record as your body
temperature
The normal temperature of human
body is 37C Note that the temperature
is stated with its unit
Paheli measured her body
temperature She got worried as
it was not exactly 37C
Let us try to assure Paheli that there
is nothing wrong with her
Activity 33
Measure the body temperature of some
of your friends at least 10 with a
Table 32 Body temperature of
some persons

Fig 33 Correct method of reading a clinical

clinical thermometer Record your
observations as in Table 32
Is the body temperature of every
person 37C
The temperature of every person may
not be 37C It could be slightly higher
or slightly lower Actually what we call
normal temperature is the average body
temperature of a large number of healthy
persons
The clinical thermometer is designed
to measure the temperature of human
body only The temperature of human
body normally does not go below 35oC
or above 42 o C That is the reason
that this thermometer has the range
35oC to 42oC
Different types of thermometers
are used for different purposes
The maximum and minimum
temperatures of the previous
day reported in weather
reports are measured by a
thermometer called the
maximum minimum
thermometer
this thermometer Look at it
carefully and note the highest and
the lowest temperature it can
measure The range of a
laboratory thermometer is
generally from 10C to 110C
Fig 34 Also as you did in the
case of the clinical thermometer
find out how much a small
division on this thermometer
reads You would need this
information to read the
thermometer correctly
Let us now learn how this
thermometer is used
Boojho got a naughty idea He
wanted to measure the temperature
of hot milk using a clinical
thermometer Paheli stopped him
from doing so
CAUTION
Activity 34
Do not use a clinical thermometer for
measuring the temperature of any
object other than the human body
Also avoid keeping the thermometer in
the sun or near a flame It may break
Take some tap water in a beaker
or a mug Dip the thermometer
in water so that the bulb is
immersed in water but does not
touch the bottom or the sides of
the container Hold the
thermometer vertically Fig 35
Observe the movement of mercury
in the thermometer Wait till the
mercury thread becomes steady
33 LABORATORY THERMOMETER
How do we measure the temperature of
other objects For this purpose there
are other thermometers One such
thermometer is known as the laboratory
thermometer The teacher will show you
Fig 34 A laboratory thermometer
HEAT
27
In addition to the precautions to be taken while reading a clinical
thermometer the laboratory thermometer
 should be kept upright not tilted Fig 35
 bulb should be surrounded from all sides by the substance of which the
temperature is to be measured The bulb should not touch the surface of the
container
Are there any variations in the
readings Discuss the possible reasons
Let us try to answer this question
Activity 35
Note the reading This is the temperature
of water at that time
Compare the temperature of water
recorded by each student in the class
Take some hot water in a beaker or a
mug Dip the thermometer in water
Wait till the mercury thread becomes
steady and note the temperature Now
take out the thermometer from water
Observe carefully what happens now
Do you notice that as soon as you take
the thermometer out of water the level
of mercury begins to fall This means
that the temperature must be read while
the thermometer is in water
You may recall that while taking your
own temperature you have to take the
thermometer out of your mouth to note
the reading Can you then use the
laboratory thermometer to measure your
Boojho now understands why
clinical thermometer cannot be
used to measure high
temperatures But still wonders
whether a laboratory thermometer
can be used to measure his body
temperature
Boojho wonders why the level
of mercury should change at
all when the bulb of the
thermometer is brought in contact
with another object
Fig 35 Measuring temperature of water with a
laboratory thermometer
28
body temperature Obviously it is not
convenient to use the laboratory
thermometer for this purpose
Why does the mercury not fall or rise
in a clinical thermometer when taken
out of the mouth
Observe a clinical thermometer
again Do you see a kink near the bulb
Fig 36
What is the use of the kink It
prevents mercury level from falling on
its own
Fig 36 A clinical thermometer has a kink in it
There is a lot of concern over
the use of mercury in
thermometers Mercury is a
toxic substance and is very
difficult to dispose of if a
thermometer breaks These
days digital thermometers
are available which do not
use mercury
Paheli asks Does it mean
that heat will not be
transferred if the temperature of
two objects is the same
in all cases heat flows from a hotter
object to a colder object
How does heat flow Let us
investigate
Activity 36
Take a rod or flat strip of a metal say of
aluminium or iron Fix a few small wax
pieces on the rod These pieces should
be at nearly equal distances Fig 37
Clamp the rod to a stand If you do not
find a stand you can put one end of
the rod in between bricks Now heat
the other end of the rod and observe
What happens to the wax pieces Do
these pieces begin to fall Which piece
falls the first Do you think that heat is
34 TRANSFER OF HEAT
You might have observed that a frying
pan becomes hot when kept on a flame
It is because the heat passes from the
flame to the utensil When the pan is
removed from the fire it slowly cools
down Why does it cool down The heat
is transferred from the pan to the
surroundings So you can understand
that in both cases the heat flows from
a hotter object to a colder object In fact
Fig 37 Flow of heat through a metal strip
transferred from the end nearest to the
flame to the other end
The process by which heat is
transferred from the hotter end to the
colder end of an object is known as
conduction In solids generally the
HEAT
29
Fig 38 Conduction of heat by different
materials
heat is transferred by the process of
conduction
Do all substances conduct heat
easily You must have observed that
the metallic pan for cooking has a plastic
or wooden handle Can you lift a hot
pan by holding it from the handle
without getting hurt
minutes Touch the other end Enter
your observation in Table 33
The materials which allow heat to
pass through them easily are
conductors of heat For examples
aluminum iron and copper The
materials which do not allow heat to
pass through them easily are poor
conductors of heat such as plastic and
wood Poor conductors are known as
insulators
The water and air are poor
conductors of heat Then how does the
heat transfer take place in these
substances Let us find out
Activity 38
Take a round bottom flask if flask is
not available a beaker can be used Fill
it twothirds with water Place it on a
tripod or make some arrangement to
place the flask in such a way that you
can heat it by placing a candle below it

still Place a crystal of potassium

sides moves down towards

water also gets hot and rises
30
Fig 310 Transfer of heat by convection in air
Fig 39 Convection of heat in water
and water from the sides moves down
This process continues till the whole
water gets heated This mode of heat
transfer is known as convection
How does the heat travel in air In
which direction does the smoke go
The air near the heat source gets hot
and rises The air from the sides comes
in to take its place In this way the air
gets heated The following activity
confirms this idea
Activity 39
Light a candle Keep one hand above the
flame and one hand on the side of the
flame Fig 310 Do your hands feel
equally hot If not which hand feels
hotter And why
Be careful Keep your hands at a safe
distance from the flame so that they
do not get burnt
Notice that towards the top the air
gets heated by convection Therefore the
hand above the flame feels hot On the
sides however there is no convection
and air does not feel as hot as at
the top
The people living in the coastal areas
experience an interesting phenomenon
During the day the land gets heated
faster than the water The air over the
land becomes hotter and rises up The
cooler air from the sea rushes in towards
the land to take its place The warm air
from the land moves towards the sea to
complete the cycle Fig 311 The air
from the sea is called the sea breeze To
receive the cooler sea breeze the windows
of the houses in coastal areas are made
to face the sea At night it is exactly the
reverse The water cools down more
slowly than the land So the cool air
from the land moves towards the sea
This is called the land breeze
When we come out in the sun we
feel warm How does the heat from the
sun reach us It cannot reach us by
conduction or convection as there is no
medium such as air in most part of the
space between the earth and the sun

From the sun the heat comes to us by
another process known as radiation
The transfer of heat by radiation does
not require any medium It can take
place whether a medium is present or
not When we sit in front of a room
heater we get heat by this process A
hot utensil kept away from the flame
cools down as it transfers heat to the
surroundings by radiation Our body
too gives heat to the surroundings and
receives heat from it by radiation
All hot bodies radiate heat When
this heat falls on some object a part of
it is reflected a part is absorbed and a
part may be transmitted The
temperature of the object increases due
to the absorbed part of the heat Why
are you advised to use an umbrella when
you go out in the sun
35 KINDS OF CLOTHES WE WEAR IN
SUMMER  WINTER
You know that in summer we prefer
lightcoloured clothes and in winter we
usually wear darkcoloured clothes Why
is it so Let us find out
Activity 310
Take two identical tin cans Paint the
outer surface of one black and of the
other white Fig 312 Pour equal
amounts of water in each and leave them
in the midday sun for about an hour
Measure the temperature of water in
both the cans Do you find any
difference in the temperatures In
32
We often use electricity and fuels like coal and wood to keep our houses cool or
warm Is it possible to construct buildings that are not affected much by heat
and cold outside This can be done by constructing outer walls of buildings so
that they have trapped layers of air One way of doing this is to use hollow
bricks which are available these days
Fig 312 Containers with black and white
surface
which can is the water warmer You
can feel the difference even by touching
water in the two cans
Activity 311
Fill the two cans used in Activity 310
with the same amount of hot water at
the same temperature say at 60oC
Leave the cans in a room or in a shade
Note the temperature of water after
1015 minutes Does the temperature
of water in both the cans fall by the same
amount
Do these activities suggest to you the
reason why it is more comfortable to
wear white or lightcoloured clothes in
the summer and darkcoloured clothes
in the winter Dark surfaces absorb
more heat and therefore we feel
comfortable with dark coloured clothes
in the winter Light coloured clothes
reflect most of the heat that falls on them
and therefore we feel more comfortable
wearing them in the summer
Woollen clothes keep us warm
in winter
In the winter we use woollen clothes
Wool is a poor conductor of heat
Moreover there is air trapped in between
the wool fibres This air prevents the flow
of heat from our body to the cold
surroundings So we feel warm
Suppose you are given the choice in
winter of using either one thick blanket
or two thin blankets joined together
What would you choose and why
Remember that there would be a layer
of air in between the blankets

What you have learnt
Our sense of touch is not always a reliable guide to the degree of hotness
of an object
Temperature is a measure of the degree of hotness of an object
Thermometer is a device used for measuring temperature
Clinical thermometer is used to measure our body temperature The
range of this thermometer is from 35C to 42C For other purposes we
use the laboratory thermometers The range of these thermometers is
usually from 10C to 110C
The normal temperature of the human body is 37C
The heat flows from a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lower
temperature There are three ways in which heat can flow from one
object to another These are conduction convection and radiation
In solids generally the heat is transferred by conduction In liquids
and gases the heat is transferred by convection No medium is required
for transfer of heat by radiation
The materials which allow heat to pass through them easily are
conductors of heat
The materials which do not allow heat to pass through them easily are
called insulators
Darkcoloured objects absorb more heat than the lightcoloured objects
That is the reason we feel more comfortable in lightcoloured clothes in
the summer
Woollen clothes keep us warm during winter It is so because wool is a
poor conductor of heat and it has air trapped in between the fibres

Curd lemon juice orange juice and
vinegar taste sour These substances
taste sour because they contain acids
The chemical nature of such substances
is acidic The word acid comes from the
Latin word acere which means sour
The acids in these substances are
natural acids
What about baking soda Does it also
taste sour If not what is its taste Since
it does not taste sour it means that it
has no acids in it It is bitter in taste If
you rub its solution between fingers it
feels soapy Generally substances like
these which are bitter in taste and feel
soapy on touching are known as bases
The nature of such substances is said to
be basic
If we cannot taste every substance
how do we find its nature
Special type of substances are used
to test whether a substance is acidic or
basic These substances are known as
indicators The indicators change their
colour when added to a solution
containing an acidic or a basic
substance Turmeric litmus China rose
petals Gudhal etc are some of the
naturally occurring indicators

Are you familiar with the term acid rain Have you ever heard about damaging
effect of acid rain As the name indicates the rain containing excess of acids is
called an acid rain Where do these acids come from The rain becomes acidic
because carbon dioxide sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide which are released
into the air as pollutants dissolve in rain drops to form carbonic acid sulphuric
acid and nitric acid respectively Acid rain can cause damage to buildings
historical monuments plants and animals
CAUTION
Great care should be taken while
handling laboratory acids and bases
because these are corrosive in nature
irritating and harmful to skin
Demonstrate the effect of the three
indicators on each of these solutions
Record your observations in Table 45
43 NEUTRALISATION
We have learnt that acids turn blue
litmus red and bases turn red litmus
blue Let us see what happens when an
acid is mixed with a base
We are going to use an indicator you
have not used so far It is called
phenolphthalein
Stir the tube gently Is there any change
in the colour of the solution Continue
adding the sodium hydroxide solution
drop by drop while stirring till the pink
colour just appears
Now add one more drop of dilute
hydrochloric acid What do you observe
The solution again becomes colourless
Again add one drop of sodium
hydroxide solution Is there any change
in colour The solution again becomes
pink in colour
It is evident that when the solution
is basic phenolphthalein gives a pink
colour On the other hand when the
solution is acidic it remains colourless
Activity 45
To be demonstrated by the teacher in
the class
Fill one fourth of a test tube with dilute
hydrochloric acid Note down its colour
Note down the colour of phenolphthalein
solution also Add 23 drops of the
indicator to the acid Now shake the test
tube gently Do you observe any change
in colour of the acid
Add to the acidic solution a drop of
sodium hydroxide solution by a dropper

43
When an acidic solution is mixed
with a basic solution both the solutions
neutralise the effect of each other When
an acid solution and a base solution are
mixed in suitable amounts both the
acidic nature of the acid and the basic
nature of the base are destroyed The
resulting solution is neither acidic nor
basic Touch the test tube immediately
after neutralisation What do you
observe In neutralisation reaction heat
is always produced or evolved The
evolved heat raises the temperature of
the reaction mixture
In neutralisation reaction a new
substance is formed This is called salt
Salt may be acidic basic or neutral in
nature Thus neutralisation can be
defined as follows
The reaction between an acid and
a base is known as neutralisation Salt
and water are produced in this process
with the evolution of heat

Heat is evolved
The following reaction is an example

44 NEUTRALISATION IN EVERYDAY
LIFE
Indigestion
Our stomach contains hydrochloric
acid It helps us to digest food as you
have learnt in Chapter 2 But too
much of acid in the stomach causes
indigestion Sometimes indigestion
is painful To relieve indigestion we
take an antacid such as milk of
magnesia which contains magnesium
hydroxide It neutralises the effect of
excessive acid
Ant bite
When an ant bites it injects
the acidic liquid formic acid into the
skin The effect of the acid can be
neutralised by rubbing moist baking
soda sodium hydrogencarbonate or
calamine solution which contains zinc
carbonate
Soil treatment
Excessive use of chemical fertilisers
makes the soil acidic Plants do not
grow well when the soil is either too
acidic or too basic When the soil is
too acidic it is treated with bases like
quick lime calcium oxide or slaked
lime calcium hydroxide If the soil
is basic organic matter compost is
added to it Organic matter releases
acids which neutralises the basic
nature of the soil
Factory wastes
The wastes of many factories
contain acids If they are allowed to
flow into the water bodies the acids
will kill fish and other organisms
The factory wastes are therefore
neutralised

basic
substances

What you have learnt
Acids are sour in taste Generally bases are bitter in taste and soapy to
touch
Acid turns blue litmus red Bases turn red litmus blue
Substances which are neither acidic nor basic are called neutral
Solutions of substances that show different colour in acidic basic and
neutral solutions are called indicators
An acid and a base neutralise each other and form a salt A salt may be
acidic basic or neutral in nature

Physical and
Chemical Changes
very day you come across many
changes in your surroundings
These changes may involve one
or more substances For example your
mother may ask you to dissolve sugar
in water to make a cold drink Making a
sugar solution is a change Similarly
setting curd from milk is a change
Sometimes milk becomes sour Souring
of milk is a change Stretched rubber
band also represents a change
Make a list of ten changes you have
noticed around you
In this chapter we shall perform some
activities and study the nature of these
changes Broadly these changes are of
two kinds physical and chemical
51 PHYSICAL CHANGES
Activity 51
Cut a piece of paper in four square
pieces Cut each square piece further
into four square pieces Lay these pieces
on the floor or a table so that the pieces
acquire the shape of the original piece
of paper Fig 51
Obviously you cannot join the pieces
back to make the original piece but is
there a change in the property of the
paper
Activity 52
Collect the chalk dust lying on the floor
near the chalkboard in your classroom
Or crush a small piece of chalk into
dust Add a little water to the dust to
make a paste Roll it into the shape of a
piece of chalk Let it dry
Did you recover chalk from the
dust
Activity 53

Paper pieces
Take some ice in a glass or plastic
tumbler Melt a small portion of ice by
placing the tumbler in the sun You have
now a mixture of ice and water Now
place the tumbler in a freezing mixture
ice plus common salt
Does the water become solid ice once
again
Activity 54
Boil some water in a container Do you
see the steam rising from the surface of
water Hold an inverted pan by its
handle over the steam at some distance
from the boiling water Observe the
inner surface of the pan
Do you see any droplet of water
there
Activity 55
CAUTION
Be careful while handling a flame
Hold a used hacksaw blade with a
pair of tongs Keep the tip of the free
end of the blade on the gas stove Wait
for a few minutes
Does the colour of the tip of the blade
change
Remove the blade from the flame
Observe the tip once again after some
time
Does it get back its original colour
In Activities 51 and 52 above you
saw that paper and a piece of chalk
underwent changes in size In Activities
53 and 54 water changed its state from
solid to liquid or from gas to liquid In
Activity 55 the hacksaw blade
changed colour on heating
Properties such as shape size colour
and state of a substance are called its
physical properties A change in which
a substance undergoes a change in its
physical properties is called a physical
change A physical change is generally
reversible In such a change no new
substance is formed
Let us now consider the other kind
of change
52 CHEMICAL CHANGE
A change with which you are quite
familiar is the rusting of iron If you
leave a piece of iron in the open for some
time it acquires a film of brownish
substance This substance is called rust
and the process is called rusting
Fig 52 Iron gates of parks or
farmlands iron benches kept in lawns
and gardens almost every article of iron
kept in the open gets rusted At home
you must have seen shovels and spades
getting rusted when exposed to the
Fig 52 Rusting iron
48
atmosphere for some time In the
kitchen a wet iron pan tawa often gets
rusted if left in that state for some time
Rust is not iron It is different from iron
on which it gets deposited
Let us consider a few more changes
where new substances are formed
Activity 56
To be demonstrated by the teacher
CAUTION
It is dangerous to look for long at the
burning magnesium ribbon The
teachers should advise children not
to stare at the burning ribbon
Get a small piece of a thin strip or
ribbon of magnesium Clean its tip with
sandpaper Bring the tip near a candle
flame It burns with a brilliant white
Fig 53 Magnesium ribbon burning
light Fig 53 When it is completely
burnt it leaves behind a powdery ash
Does the ash look like the
magnesium ribbon
The change can be represented by
the following equation
Magnesium Mg  Oxygen O2 
Magnesium oxide MgO
The equations here are different from
those in mathematics In equations
of this kind the arrow implies
becomes No attempt should be made
to balance chemical equations at this
stage
Collect the ash and mix it with a
small amount of water Stir the mixture
aqueous solution well Test the mixture
with blue and red litmus papers
Does the mixture turn red litmus
blue
Does the mixture turn blue litmus
red
On the basis of this test how do you
classify the aqueous solution  acidic
or basic
On dissolving the ash in water it
forms a new substance This change can
be written in the form of the following
equation
Magnesium oxide MgO  Water
H2O Magnesium hydroxide MgOH2
As you have already learnt in
Chapter 4 magnesium hydroxide is a base
So magnesium oxide is a new substance
formed on burning of magnesium
Magnesium hydroxide is another new
PHYSICAL  CHEMICAL CHANGES

substance formed by mixing magnesium
oxide with water
Activity 57
To be demonstrated by the teacher
Dissolve about a teaspoonful of copper
sulphate blue vitriol or neela thotha in
about half a cup of water in a glass
tumbler or a beaker Add a few drops of
dilute sulphuric acid to the solution
You should get a blue coloured solution
Save a small sample of the solution in a
test tube or a small glass bottle Drop a
nail or a used shaving blade into the
remaining solution Wait for half an
hour or so Observe the colour of the
solution Compare it with the colour of
the sample solution saved separately
Fig 54
colour of the solution from blue to
green is due to the formation of iron
sulphate a new substance The brown
deposit on the iron nail is copper
another new substance We can write
the reaction as
Copper sulphate solution blue  Iron
 Iron sulphate solution green
 Copper brown deposit
Activity 58
Take about a teaspoonful of vinegar in
a test tube Add a pinch of baking soda
to it You would hear a hissing sound
and see bubbles of a gas coming out
Pass this gas through freshly prepared
lime water as shown in Fig 55
What happens to the lime water
Iron sulphate greenish
Copper sulphate
blue
Fig 54 Change in colour of the copper sulphate
solution due to reaction with iron
Do you see any change in the colour
of the solution
Take out the nail or the blade
Has it changed in any way
The changes that you notice are
due to a reaction between copper
sulphate and iron The change of
The change in the test tube is as
follows
Vinegar Acetic acid  Baking soda
Sodium hydrogencarbonate 
Carbon dioxide  other substances
The reaction between carbon dioxide
and lime water is as follows

Carbon
dioxide
Vinegar 
Baking soda
Lime
water
Fig 55 Set up to pass gas through lime water
Carbon dioxide CO2  Lime water
CaOH 2   Calcium Carbonate
CaCO3  Water H2O
When carbon dioxide is passed
through lime water calcium carbonate
is formed which makes lime water milky
The turning of lime water into milky is a
standard test of carbon dioxide You will
use it in Chapter 6 to show that the air
we breathe out is rich in carbon dioxide
In Activities 5658 you saw that
in each change one or more new
substances were formed In Activity 56
the ash was the new substance formed
when magnesium was burnt in air In
Activity 57 the reaction of copper
sulphate with iron produced iron
sulphate and copper Both of these are
new substances Copper was deposited
on the shaving blade of iron In Activity
58 vinegar and baking soda together
produced carbon dioxide which turned
lime water milky Can you name the new
substance formed in this reaction
A change in which one or more
new substances are formed is called a
chemical change A chemical change
is also called a chemical reaction
Chemical changes are very important
in our lives All new substances are
formed as a result of chemical changes
For example digestion of food in our
body ripening of fruits fermentation of
grapes etc happen due to series of
chemical changes A medicine is the end
product of a chain of chemical reactions
Useful new materials such as plastics
and detergents are produced by
chemical reactions Indeed every new
material is discovered by studying
chemical changes
We have seen that one or more new
substances are produced in a chemical
change In addition to new products
the following may accompany a chemical
change
 Heat light or any other radiation
ultraviolet for example may be given
off or absorbed
 Sound may be produced
 A change in smell may take place or
a new smell may be given off
 A colour change may take place 
 A gas may be formed
Let us look at some examples
You saw that burning of magnesium
ribbon is a chemical change Burning
of coal wood or leaves is also a chemical
change In fact burning of any
substance is a chemical change
Burning is always accompanied by
production of heat
PHYSICAL  CHEMICAL CHANGES
51
Explosion of a firework is a chemical
change You know that such an
explosion produces heat light sound
and unpleasant gases that pollute the
atmosphere That is why you are advised
not to play with fireworks
When food gets spoiled it produces
a foul smell Shall we call this change a
chemical change
You must have noticed that a slice of
an apple acquires a brown colour if it is
not consumed immediately If you have
not seen this change in colour cut a
fresh slice of apple and keep it away for
some time Repeat the same activity with
a slice of potato or brinjal The change
of colour in these cases is due to the
formation of new substances Are not
these changes chemical changes
In Chapter 4 you neutralised an acid
with a base Is neutralisation a chemical
change
A protective shield
You must have heard of the ozone layer
in our atmosphere It protects us from
the harmful ultraviolet radiation which
come from the sun Ozone absorbs this
radiation and breaks down to oxygen
Oxygen is different from ozone Can
we call the breaking down of ozone a
chemical change
If ultraviolet radiation were not
absorbed by ozone it would reach the
earths surface and cause harm to us
and other life forms Ozone acts as a
natural shield against this radiation
We learnt in Chapter 1 that
plants produce their food by
a process called photosynthesis
Can we call photosynthesis
a chemical change
Paheli said that even digestion
is a chemical change
53 RUSTING OF IRON
Let us get back to rusting This is one
change that affects iron articles and
slowly destroys them Since iron is used
in making bridges ships cars truck
bodies and many other articles the
monetary loss due to rusting is huge
The process of rusting can be
represented by the following equation
Iron Fe  Oxygen O2 from the air
 water H2O rust iron oxide Fe2O3
For rusting the presence of both
oxygen and water or water vapour
is essential
In fact if the content of moisture in
air is high which means if it is more
humid rusting becomes faster
So how do we prevent rusting
Prevent iron articles from coming in
contact with oxygen or water or both
One simple way is to apply a coat of
paint or grease In fact these coats
should be applied regularly to prevent
rusting Another way is to deposit a layer
of a metal like chromium or zinc on iron
52
Oh that is why my friend
Rita is always complaining
about iron articles rusting so
fast She lives near the coast
This process of depositing a layer of zinc
on iron is called galvanisation The iron
pipes we use in our homes to carry water
are galvanised to prevent rusting
You know that ships are made of iron
and a part of them remains under water
On the part above water also water
drops keep clinging to the ships outer
surface Moreover the water of the sea
contains many salts The salt water
makes the process of rust formation
faster Therefore ships suffer a lot of
damage from rusting in spite of being
Stainless steel is made by mixing iron
with carbon and metals like
chromium nickel and manganese It
does not rust
formed from their solutions The process
is called crystallisation It is an
example of a physical change
Activity 59
To be performed in the presence of
the teacher
CAUTION
Use only dilute sulphuric acid Be
careful while boiling water
Take a cupful of water in a beaker
and add a few drops of dilute sulphuric
acid Heat the water When it starts
boiling add copper sulphate powder
slowly while stirring continuously
Fig 56 Continue adding copper
sulphate powder till no more powder can
be dissolved Filter the solution Allow
it to cool Do not disturb the solution
when it is cooling Look at the solution
after some time Can you see the crystals
of copper sulphate If not wait for some
more time
painted So much so that a fraction of
ships iron has to be replaced every year
Can you imagine the monetary loss to
the world
Copper sulphate
54 CRYSTALLISATION

be obtained by the evaporation of sea
water The salt obtained in this manner
is not pure and the shape of its crystals
cannot be seen clearly However large
crystals of pure substances can be

be reversible
In chemical changes new substances are produced
Some substances can be obtained in pure state from their solutions by
crystallisation

Respiration in
Organisms
ne day Boojho was eagerly
waiting
meet
his
grandparents who were coming
to the town after a year He was in a real
hurry as he wanted to receive them at the
busstop He ran fast and reached the
busstop in a few minutes He was
breathing rapidly His grandmother asked
him why he was breathing so fast Boojho
told her that he came running all the way
But the question got stuck in his mind
He wondered why running makes a
person breathe faster The answer to
Boojhos question lies in understanding
why we breathe Breathing is a part of
respiration Let us learn about respiration
61 WHY DO WE RESPIRE
In Chapter 2 you learnt that all
organisms are made of small
microscopic units called cells A cell is
the smallest structural and functional
unit of an organism Each cell of an
organism performs certain functions
such as nutrition transport excretion
and reproduction To perform these
functions the cell needs energy Even
when we are eating sleeping or reading
we require energy But where does this
energy come from Can you say why
your parents insist that you should eat
regularly The food has stored energy
which is released during respiration
Therefore all living organisms respire
to get energy from food During
breathing we breathe in air You know
that air contains oxygen We breathe out
air which is rich in carbon dioxide The
air we breathe in is transported to all
parts of the body and ultimately to each
cell In the cells oxygen in the air helps
in the breakdown of food The process
of breakdown of food in the cell with the
release of energy is called cellular
respiration Cellular respiration takes
place in the cells of all organisms
In the cell the food glucose is broken
down into carbon dioxide and water using
oxygen When breakdown of glucose
occurs with the use of oxygen it is called
aerobic respiration Food can also be
broken down without using oxygen This
is called anaerobic respiration
Breakdown of food releases energy
You should know that there are some
organisms such as yeast that can survive
in the absence of air They are called
anaerobes They get energy through
anaerobic respiration In the absence of
oxygen glucose breaks down into alcohol
and carbon dioxide as given below
Yeasts are singlecelled organisms
They respire anaerobically and during
this process yield alcohol They are
therefore used to make wine and beer
Our muscle cells can also respire
anaerobically but only for a short time
when there is a temporary deficiency of
oxygen During heavy exercise fast
running Fig 61 cycling walking for
many hours or heavy weight lifting the
demand for energy is high But the
supply of oxygen to produce the energy
is limited Then anaerobic respiration
takes places in the muscle cells to fulfil
the demand of energy
Have you ever wondered why you get
muscle cramps after heavy exercise The
cramps occur when muscle cells respire
anaerobically The partial breakdown of
glucose produces lactic acid The
accumulation of lactic acid causes muscle
cramps We get relief from cramps after a
hot water bath or a massage Can you
guess why it is so Hot water bath or
massage improves circulation of blood
As a result the supply of oxygen to the
muscle cells increases The increase in
the supply of oxygen results in the
complete breakdown of lactic acid into
carbon dioxide and water
62 BREATHING
Activity 61
CAUTION
Do this activity under the supervision
of your teacher
Fig 61 During exercise some muscles may
respire anaerobically
Close your nostrils and mouth
tightly and look at a watch What did
you feel after some time How long were
you able to keep both of them closed
Note down the time for which you could
hold your breath Fig 62
So now you know that you cannot
survive for long without breathing
Breathing means taking in air rich
in oxygen and giving out air rich in
carbon dioxide with the help of
respiratory organs The taking in of air
rich in oxygen into the body is called
inhalation and giving out of air rich in
carbon dioxide is known as exhalation
It is a continuous process which goes
58
on all the time and throughout the life
of an organism
The number of times a person
breathes in a minute is termed as the
breathing rate During breathing
inhalation and exhalation take place
alternately A breath means one
inhalation plus one exhalation Would
Fig 62 Holding breath
Boojho noticed that when he
released his breath after holding
it for some time he had to
breathe heavily Can you tell
him why it was so
you like to find out your breathing rate
Do you want to know whether it is
constant or it changes according to the
requirement of oxygen by the body Let
us find out by doing the following
activity
Activity 62
Generally we are not aware that we are
breathing However if you try you can
count your rate of breathing Breathe
in and out normally Find out how many
times you breathe in and breathe out
in a minute Did you inhale the same
number of times as you exhaled Now
count your breathing rate number of
breathsminute after brisk walk and
after running Record your breathing
rate as soon as you finish and also after
complete rest Tabulate your findings
and compare your breathing rates under
different conditions with those of your
classmates
From the above activity you must
have realised that whenever a person
needs extra energy heshe breathes
faster As a result more oxygen is

On an average an adult human being
at rest breathes in and out 15 18
times in a minute During heavy
exercise the breathing rate can
increase upto 25 times per minute
While we exercise not only do we
breathe fast we also take deep breaths
and thus inhale more oxygen
supplied to our cells It speeds up
the breakdown of food and more
energy is released Does this explain
w h y do w e f e e l h u n g r y a f t e r a
physical activity
When you feel drowsy does your
breathing rate slow down Does your
body receive sufficient oxygen
Activity 63
Figure 63 shows the various activities
carried out by a person during a normal
Fig 63 Variation in the breathing rate during
different activities
Paheli wants to know why
we yawn when we are
sleepy or drowsy
day Can you say in which activity the
rate of breathing will be the slowest and
in which it will be the fastest Assign
numbers to the pictures in the order of
increasing rate of breathing according
to your experience
63 HOW DO WE BREATHE
Let us now learn about the mechanism
of breathing Normally we take in air
through our nostrils When we inhale
air it passes through our nostrils into
the nasal cavity From the nasal cavity
the air reaches our lungs through the
windpipe Lungs are present in the
chest cavity Fig 64 This cavity is
surrounded by ribs on the sides A large
muscular sheet called diaphragm forms
the floor of the chest cavity Fig 64
Breathing involves the movement of the
diaphragm and the rib cage
During inhalation ribs move up and
outwards and diaphragm moves down
This movement increases space in our
chest cavity and air rushes into the
lungs The lungs get filled with air
During exhalation ribs move down and
inwards while diaphragm moves up to
its former position This reduces the size
of the chest cavity and air is pushed out
of the lungs Fig 65 These movements
in our body can be felt easily Take a
60
deep breath Keep your palm on the
abdomen feel the movement of
abdomen What do you find
After having learnt that during
breathing there are changes in the size
of the chest cavity children got involved
in the chest expansion competition
Everyone was boasting that shehe
Smoking damages lungs Smoking is
also linked to cancer It must be
avoided

The air around us has various types of unwanted particles such as smoke dust
pollens etc When we inhale the particles get trapped in the hair present in our
nasal cavity However sometimes these particles may get past the hair in the
nasal cavity This may irritate the lining of the cavity as a result of which we
sneeze Sneezing expels these foreign particles from the inhaled air and a dustfree clean air enters our body
TAKE CARE When you sneeze you should cover your nose so that the foreign
particles you expel are not inhaled by other persons

We can understand the mechanism
of breathing by a simple model

bottom Get a Yshaped glass or plastic
tube Make a hole in the lid so that the
tube may pass through it To the forked
end of the tube fix two deflated balloons

You are aware that air we inhale or
exhale is a mixture of gases What do
we exhale Do we exhale only carbon
dioxide or a mixture of gases along with
it You must have also observed that if
you exhale on a mirror a film of
moisture appears on its surface From
where do these droplets come

How do other organisms breathe Do
they also have lungs like those of human
beings Let us find out
Cockroach A cockroach has small
openings on the sides of its body Other
insects also have similar openings
Fig69 Tracheal system
Earthworm Recall from Chapter 6 of
Class VI that earthworms breathe
through their skins The skin of an
earthworm feels moist and slimy on
touching Gases can easily pass through
them Though frogs have a pair of lungs
like human beings they can also
breathe through their skin which is
moist and slippery

dioxide In the cells oxygen is used to
break down glucose into carbon dioxide
and water as in other organisms In
plants each part can independently take
in oxygen from the air and give out
carbon dioxide You have already learnt
in Chapter 1 that the leaves of the plants
have tiny pores called stomata for
exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide
Boojho has seen in television
programmes that whales and
dolphins often come up to the
water surface They even release
a fountain of water sometimes
while moving upwards Why do
they do so
Paheli wants to know whether
roots which are underground
also take in oxygen If so how
66 BREATHING UNDER WATER
Can we breathe and survive in water
There are many organisms which live in
water How do they breathe under water
You have studied in Class VI that
gills in fish help them to use oxygen
dissolved in water Gills are projections
of the skin You may wonder how gills
help in breathing Gills are well supplied
with blood vessels Fig 610 for
exchange of gases
Like all other living cells of the
plants the root cells also need
oxygen to generate energy Roots take
up air from the air spaces present
between the soil particles Fig 611

What you have learnt
Respiration is essential for survival of living organisms It releases energy
from the food
The oxygen we inhale is used to breakdown glucose into carbon dioxide
and water Energy is released in the process
The breakdown of glucose occurs in the cells of an organism cellular
respiration
If the food is broken down with the use of oxygen it is called aerobic
respiration If the breakdown occurs without the use of oxygen the
respiration is called anaerobic respiration
During heavy exercise when the supply of oxygen to our muscle cells is
insufficient food breakdown is by anaerobic respiration
Breathing is a part of the process of respiration during which an
organism takes in the oxygenrich air and gives out air rich in carbon
dioxide The respiratory organs for the exchange of gases vary in different
organisms
During inhalation our lungs expand and then come back to the original
state as the air moves out during exhalation
Increased physical activity enhances the rate of breathing
In animals like cow buffalo dog and cat the respiratory organs and the
process of breathing are similar to those in humans
In earthworm the exchange of gases occurs through the moist skin In
fishes it takes place through gills and in insects through the tracheae
In a plant the roots take in air present in the soil Leaves have tiny pores
called stomata through which they exchange gases The breakdown of
glucose in the plant cells is similar to that in other living beings

sides of their heads These are flaps which cover the gills These flaps
open and close alternately On the basis of these observations explain
the process of respiration in the fish

Transportation in
Animals and Plants
ou have learnt earlier that all
organisms need food water and
oxygen for survival They need to
transport all these to various parts of
their body Further animals need to
transport wastes to parts from where
they can be removed Have you
wondered how all this is achieved Look
at Fig 71 Do you see the heart and
the blood vessels They function to
transport substances and together form
the circulatory system In this chapter
you shall learn about transport of
substances in animals and plants

71 CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Blood
What happens when you get a cut on
your body Blood flows out But what
is blood Blood is the fluid which
flows in blood vessels It transports
substances like digested food from the
small intestine to the other parts of the
body It carries oxygen from the lungs
to the cells of the body It also transports
waste for removal from the body
How does the blood carry various
substances Blood is composed of a
fluid called plasma in which different
types of cells are suspended
Why is the colour of
blood red 
Fig 71 Circulatory system
Arteries are shown in red colour and veins in blue
One type of cells are the red blood
cells RBC which contain a red pigment
called haemoglobin Haemoglobin
binds with oxygen and transports it to
all the parts of the body and ultimately
to all the cells It will be difficult to
provide oxygen efficiently to all the cells
of the body without haemoglobin The
presence of haemoglobin makes blood
appear red
The blood also has white blood cells
WBC which fight against germs that
may enter our body
Boojho fell down while playing a
game and his knee got injured Blood
was coming out from the cut After some
time he noticed that bleeding had
stopped and a dark red clot had plugged
the cut Boojho was puzzled about this
The clot is formed because of the
presence of another type of cells in the
blood called platelets
Blood vessels
There are different types of blood vessels
in the body You know that during
inhalation a fresh supply of oxygen fills
the lungs Oxygen has to be transported
to the rest of the body
Also the blood picks up the waste
materials including carbon dioxide from
the cells This blood has to go back to
the heart for transport to the lungs for
removal of carbon dioxide as you have
learnt in Chapter 6 So two types of
blood vessels arteries and veins are
present in the body Fig 71
Arteries carry oxygenrich blood
from the heart to all parts of the body
Since the blood flow is rapid and at a
high pressure the arteries have thick
elastic walls
Let us perform an activity to study
the flow of blood through arteries
Activity 71
Place the middle and index finger of
your right hand on the inner side of your
left wrist Fig 72 Can you feel some
throbbing movements Why do you
think there is throbbing This
throbbing is called the pulse and it is
due to the blood flowing in the arteries
Count the number of pulse beats in one
minute
How many pulse beats could you
count The number of beats per minute
is called the pulse rate A resting
person usually has a pulse rate between
72 and 80 beats per minute Find other
places in your body where you can feel
the pulse
Record your own pulse beats per
minute and those of your classmates
Insert the values you obtained in
Table 71 and compare them

I am confused I have learnt
that an artery always
carries oxygenrich blood
Paheli explained that the
pulmonary artery carries blood
from the heart so it is called an
artery and not a vein It carries
carbon dioxiderich blood to the
lungs Pulmonary vein carries
oxygenrich blood from the
lungs to the heart
Veins are the vessels which carry
carbon dioxiderich blood from all parts
of the body back to the heart The veins
have thin walls There are valves present
in veins which allow blood to flow only
towards the heart

Blood Donation
Hundreds of people die due to
unavailability of blood Voluntary
blood donation is harmless and
painless and can save precious lives
Blood can be donated at hospitals and
other places authorised by the
government Donated blood are stored
with special care in Blood Banks
The heart is an organ which beats
continuously to act as a pump for the
transport of blood which carries other
substances with it
Imagine a pump working for
years without stopping Absolutely
impossible Yet our heart works like a
pump nonstop Let us now learn about
the heart
The heart is located in the chest
cavity with its lower tip slightly tilted
towards the left Fig 71 Hold your
fingers inwards on your palm That
72
makes your fist Your heart is roughly
the size of your fist
What will happen if the blood rich in
oxygen and the blood rich in carbon
dioxide mix with each other To avoid
this from happening the heart has four
chambers The two upper chambers are
called the atria singular atrium and
the two lower chambers are called the
ventricles Fig 74 The partition
between the chambers helps to avoid

To understand the functioning of the
circulatory system start from the right
side of the heart in Fig 73 and follow
the arrows These arrows show the
direction of the blood flow from the heart

to the lungs and back to the heart from
where it is pumped to the rest of the
body
Heartbeat
The walls of the chambers of the heart
are made up of muscles These muscles
contract and relax rhythmically This
rhythmic contraction followed by its
relaxation constitute a heartbeat
Remember that heartbeats continue
every moment of our life If you place
your hand on the left side of your chest
you can feel your heartbeat The doctor
feels your heartbeats with the help of
an instrument called a stethoscope
A doctor uses the stethoscope as a
device to amplify the sound of the heart
It consists of a chest piece that carries a
sensitive diaphragm two ear pieces and
a tube joining the parts Doctors can
get clues about the condition of your

heart by listening through a

after running for 45 minutes Compare
your observations
Record your own pulse rate and heart
beat and that of your friends while
resting and after running and record in
Table 72 Do you find any relationship
between your heart beat and pulse rate
Each heart beat generates one pulse in
the arteries and the pulse rate per
minute indicates the rate of heart beat
The rhythmic beating of the various
chambers of the heart maintain
circulation of blood and transport of
substances to the different parts of the
body
Boojho wonders if sponges and
hydra also have blood Animals such
as sponges and Hydra do not possess
any circulatory system The water in
which they live brings food and oxygen
The English physician William Harvey
AD1578 1657 discovered the
circulation of blood The current
opinion in those days was that blood
oscillates in the vessels of the body
For his views Harvey was ridiculed
and was called circulator He lost
most of his patients However before
he died Harveys idea about
circulation was generally accepted as
a biological fact
as it enters their bodies The water
carries away waste materials and carbon
dioxide as it moves out Thus these
animals do not need a circulatory fluid
like the blood
Let us now learn about the removal
of waste other than carbon dioxide
72 EXCRETION IN ANIMALS
Recall how carbon dioxide is removed
as waste from the body through the
lungs during exhalation Also recall that
the undigested food is removed during
egestion Let us now find out how the
other waste materials are removed from
the body You may wonder where these
unwanted materials come from
When our cells perform their
functions certain waste products are
released These are toxic and hence need
to be removed from the body The
process of removal of wastes produced
in the cells of the living organisms is
called excretion The parts involved in
excretion form the excretory system
Excretory system in humans
The waste which is present in the blood
has to be removed from the body How
can this be done A mechanism to filter
the blood is required This is done by
the blood capillaries in the kidneys
When the blood reaches the two kidneys
it contains both useful and harmful
substances The useful substances are
absorbed back into the blood The
wastes dissolved in water are removed
as urine From the kidneys the urine
goes into the urinary bladder through
TRANSPORTATION IN ANIMALS  PLANTS
75
contains water and salts Boojho has
seen that sometimes in summer white
patches are formed on our clothes
especially in areas like underarms
These marks are left by salts present in
the sweat
Does sweat serve any other function
We know that the water kept in an
earthen pot matka is cooler This is
because the water evaporates from the
pores of the pot which causes cooling
Kidney
Ureter
Paheli wants to know
whether other animals also
urinate
Urinary bladder
Urethra
Urinary opening
Fig 76 Human excretory system
tubelike ureters It is stored in the
bladder and is passed out through the
urinary opening at the end of a
muscular tube called urethra Fig 76
The kindeys ureters bladder and
urethra form the excretory system
An adult human being normally
passes about 118 L of urine in 24
hours The urine consists of 95 water
25 urea and 25 other waste
products
We have all experienced that we sweat
on a hot summer day The sweat
The way in which waste chemicals
are removed from the body of the
animal depends on the availability
of water Aquatic animals like fishes
excrete cell waste as ammonia which
directly dissolves in water Some
land animals like birds lizards
snakes excrete a semisolid white
coloured compound uric acid The
major excretory product in humans
is urea
Sometimes a persons kidneys may
stop working due to infection or
injury As a result of kidney failure
waste products start accumulating in
the blood Such persons cannot
survive unless their blood is filtered
periodically through an artificial
kidney This process is called dialysis
76
Similarly when we sweat it helps to cool
our body
73 TRANSPORT OF SUBSTANCES IN
PLANTS
In Chapter 1 you learnt that plants take
water and mineral nutrients from the soil
through the roots and transport it to the
leaves The leaves prepare food for the
plant using water and carbon dioxide
during photosynthesis You also learnt in
Chapter 6 that food is the source of energy
and every cell of an organism gets energy
by the breakdown of glucose The cells
use this energy to carry out vital activities
of life Therefore food must be made
available to every cell of an organism
Have you ever wondered how water and
nutrients absorbed by the root are
transported to the leaves How is the
food prepared by the leaves carried to
the parts which cannot make food
The root hair increase the surface area
of the root for the absorption of water
and mineral nutrients dissolved in
water The root hair is in contact with
the water present between the soil
particles Fig 77 a
Can you guess how water moves
from the root to the leaves What kind
of transport system is present in plants
Boojho thinks that plants
may have pipes to transport
water to the entire plant like
we have in our homes for the
supply of water
Transport of water and
minerals
Plants absorb water and minerals by
the roots The roots have root hair

Well Boojho is right Plants have
pipelike vessels to transport water and
nutrients from the soil The vessels are
made of special cells forming the
vascular tissue A tissue is a group of
cells that perform specialised function
in an organism The vascular tissue for
the transport of water and nutrients in the
plant is called the xylem Fig 77 a
The xylem forms a continuous
network of channels that connects roots
to the leaves through the stem and
branches and thus transports water to
the entire plant Fig 77 b

Paheli says her mother puts
ladyfinger and other vegetables in
water if they are somewhat dry
She wants to know how water
enters into them
You know that leaves synthesise
food The food has to be transported to
all parts of the plant This is done by
the vascular tissue called the phloem
Thus xylem and phloem transport
substances in plants
Activity 73
We would require a glass tumbler water
red ink a tender herb eg Balsam
and a blade for this activity
Pour water to fill onethird of the
tumbler Add a few drops of red ink to
the water Cut the base of the stem of
the herb and place it in the glass as shown
in Fig 78a Observe it the next day
Does any part of the herb appear
red If yes how do you think the colour
reached there
You can cut the stem across and look
for the red colour inside the stem
Fig 78b and 78c
From this activity we see that water
moves up the stem In other words stem
conducts water Just like the red ink
minerals dissolved in water also move
up the stem along with water Water
and minerals go to leaves and other
plant parts through narrow tubes
xylem inside the stem Fig 77b
78
Boojho wants to know why
plants absorb a large quantity
of water from the soil then give
it off by transpiration
Transpiration
In Class VI you learnt that plants
release a lot of water by the process of
transpiration
Plants absorb mineral nutrients and
water from the soil Not all the water
absorbed is utilised by the plant The water
evaporates through the stomata present
on the surface of the leaves by the process
of transpiration The evaporation of water
from leaves generates a suction pull the
same that you produce when you suck
water through a straw which can
pull water to great heights in the
tall trees Transpiration also cools
the plant

What you have learnt
In most animals the blood that circulates in the body distributes food
and oxygen to different cells of the body It also carries waste products
from different parts of the body for excretion
Circulatory system consists of the heart and blood vessels
In humans blood flows through arteries and veins and the heart acts
as a pumping organ
Blood consists of plasma RBC WBC and platelets Blood is red due to
the presence of a red pigment haemoglobin
The human heart beats about 7080 times per minute in an adult
person This is called heart rate
Arteries carry blood from the heart to all parts of the body
Veins carry blood from all parts of the body back to the heart
Removal of waste products from the body is called excretion
TRANSPORTATION IN ANIMALS  PLANTS
79
Excretory system of humans consists of two kidneys two ureters a
urinary bladder and urethra
Salts and urea are removed along with water as sweat
Fish excrete waste substances such as ammonia which directly dissolve
in water
Birds insects and lizard excrete uric acid in semisolid form
Water and mineral nutrients are absorbed by roots from the soil
Nutrients are transported along with water to the entire plant via the
vascular tissue called xylem
The vascular tissue for the transport of food to the various parts of the
plant is phloem
A lot of water is lost by plants in the form of vapour through stomata
during transpiration
Transpiration generates a force which pulls up water absorbed by the
roots from the soil to reach the stem and leaves

Reproduction in Plants
o produce its kind is a
characteristic of all living
organisms You have already
learnt this in Class VI The production
of new individuals from their parents is
known as reproduction But how do
plants reproduce There are different
modes of reproduction in plants which
we shall learn in this chapter
81 MODES OF REPRODUCTION
In Class VI you learnt about different
parts of a flowering plant Try to list the
various parts of a plant and write the
functions of each Most plants have
roots stems and leaves These are called
the vegetative parts of a plant After a
certain period of growth most plants
bear flowers You may have seen the
mango trees flowering in spring It is
these flowers that give rise to juicy
mango fruit we enjoy in summer We eat
the fruits and usually discard the seeds
Seeds germinate and form new plants
So what is the function of flowers in
plants Flowers perform the function of
reproduction in plants Flowers are the
reproductive parts
There are several ways by which
plants produce their offspring These are
categorised into two types i asexual
and ii sexual reproduction In asexual
reproduction plants can give rise to new
plants without seeds whereas in sexual
reproduction new plants are obtained
from seeds
Paheli thought that new
plants always grow from seeds
But she has never seen the seeds
of sugarcane potato and rose She
wants to know how these plants
reproduce
Asexual reproduction
In asexual reproduction new plants are
obtained without production of seeds
Vegetative propagation
It is a type of asexual reproduction in
which new plants are produced from
roots stems leaves and buds Since
reproduction is through the vegetative
parts of the plant it is known as
vegetative propagation
Activity 81
Cut a branch of rose or champa with a
node This piece of branch is termed a
cutting Bury the cutting in the soil A
node is a part of the stembranch at
which a leaf arises Fig 81 Water the
cutting every day and observe its
growth Observe and record the number
of days taken for roots to come out and
new leaves to arise Try the same activity
by growing money plant in a jar of water
and record your observations
Node
Fig 82 Potato plant sprouting from an eye
Likewise you can also grow ginger
Fig 83 or turmeric
Bryophyllum sprout leaf plant has
buds in the margins of leaves Fig 84
If a leaf of this plant falls on a moist
Bud in
the axil
Fig 81 Stemcutting of rose
You must have seen flower buds
developing into flowers Apart from
flower buds there are buds in the axil
point of attachment of the leaf at the
node of leaves which develop into
shoots These buds are called vegetative
buds Fig 82 A bud consists of a short
stem around which immature
overlapping leaves are present Vegetative
buds can also give rise to new plants
Activity 82
Take a fresh potato Observe the scars
on it with the help of a magnifying glass
You may find buds in them These scars
are also called eyes Cut the potato
into small portions each with an eye
and bury them in the soil Water the
pieces regularly for a few days and
observe their progress What do you find
Fig 83 Ginger with new plants sprouting
from it
soil each bud can give rise to a new
plant
Roots of some plants can also give
rise to new plants Sweet potato and
dahlia are examples
Plants such as cacti produce new
plants when their parts get detached

Boojho wants to know if
there is any advantage of
vegetative propagation
To be demonstrated by the teacher
Take a piece of yeast cake or yeast
powder from a bakery or a chemist shop
Take a pinch of yeast and place it in a
container with some water Add a
spoonful of sugar and shake to dissolve
it Keep it in the warm part of a room
After an hour put a drop of this liquid
on a glass slide and observe under a
microscope What do you observe You
may see the formation of new yeast cells
Fig 85
Developing bud
Yeast cell
Plants produced by vegetative
propagation take less time to grow and
bear flowers and fruits earlier than those
produced from seeds The new plants
are exact copies of the parent plant as
they are produced from a single parent
Later in this chapter you will learn
that plants produced by sexual
reproduction have characters of both the
parents Plants produce seeds as a result
of sexual reproduction
Budding
You have already learnt about the tiny
organisms like yeast can be seen only
under a microscope These grow and
multiply every few hours if sufficient
nutrients are made available to them
Remember that yeast is a singlecelled
organism Let us see how they
reproduce
Chain of buds
New bud
Fig 85 Reproduction in yeast by budding
The small bulblike projection
coming out from the yeast cell is called
a bud The bud gradually grows and
gets detached from the parent cell and
forms a new yeast cell The new yeast
cell grows matures and produces more
yeast cells Sometimes another bud
arises from the bud forming a chain of
buds If this process continues a large
number of yeast cells are produced in a
short time
Fragmentation
You might have seen slimy green
patches in ponds or in other stagnant
water bodies These are the algae When
84
water and nutrients are available algae
grow and multiply rapidly by
fragmentation An alga breaks up into
two or more fragments These fragments
or pieces grow into new individuals
Fig 86 This process continues and
they cover a large area in a short period
of time

Spore formation
In Chapter 1 you learnt that the fungi
on a bread piece grow from spores which
are present in the air Repeat Activity
12 Observe the spores in the cottonlike mesh on the bread When spores
are released they keep floating in the
Sporangium
Spores
air As they are very light they can cover
long distances
Spores are asexual reproductive
bodies Each spore is covered by a
hard protective coat to withstand
unfavourable conditions such as high
temperature and low humidity So
they can survive for a long time Under
favourable conditions a spore
germinates and develops into a new
individual Plants such as moss and
ferns Fig 88 also reproduce by means
of spores

You have learnt earlier the structure of
a flower You know that the flowers are
the reproductive parts of a plant
Stamens are the male reproductive part
and pistil is the female reproductive part
Fig 89
REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS
85
Activity 84
Take a mustardChina rosepetunia
flower and separate its reproductive
parts Study the various parts of a
stamen and pistil
Flowers which contain either only
pistil or only stamens are called
unisexual flowers Flowers which
contain both stamens and pistil are
called bisexual flowers Corn papaya
and cucumber produce unisexual
flowers whereas mustard rose and
petunia have bisexual flowers Both
male and female unisexual flowers may
be present in the same plant or in
different plants
Could you identify the anther and
the filament of a stamen Fig 89 a
Anther contains pollen grains which
produce male gametes A pistil consists
of stigma style and ovary Ovary
contains one or more ovules The
female gamete or the egg is formed in
an ovule Fig 89 b In sexual
reproduction a male and a female
gamete fuse to form a zygote
Boojho wants to know how the
male gamete in the pollen grain
reaches the female gamete present
in the ovule

the pollen lands on the stigma of a flower
of the same kind The transfer of pollen
from the anther to the stigma of a flower
is called pollination If the pollen lands
on the stigma of the same flower or
another flower of the same plant it is
called selfpollination When the pollen
of a flower lands on the stigma of a flower
of a different plant of the same kind it
is called crosspollination Fig 810 a

After fertilisation the ovary grows into
a fruit and other parts of the flower fall
off The fruit is the ripened ovary The
seeds develop from the ovules The seed
contains an embryo enclosed in a
protective seed coat
Some fruits are fleshy and juicy such
as mango and orange Some fruits are
hard like almonds and walnuts
Fig 812 a and b
84 SEED DISPERSAL
In nature same kind of plants grow at
different places This happens because
seeds are dispersed to different places
Sometimes after a walk through a forest
or a field or a park you may have found
seeds or fruits sticking to your clothes
REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS
87
Did you try to observe how these seeds
were clinging to your clothes
What do you think will happen if all
seeds of a plant were to fall at the same
place and grow there There would be
severe competition for sunlight water
minerals and space As a result the seeds
would not grow into healthy plants
Plants benefit by seed dispersal It
prevents competition between the plant
and its own seedlings for sunlight water
and minerals It also enables the plants
to invade new habitats for wider
distribution
Seeds and fruits of plants are carried
away by wind water and animals
Winged seeds such as those of drumstick
and maple Fig 813 a and b light
seeds of grasses or hairy seeds of aak
Madar and hairy fruit of sunflower
Fig 814 a b get blown off with the
wind to far away places Some seeds are
dispersed by water These fruits or seeds
usually develop floating ability in the
form of spongy or fibrous outer coat as
in coconut Some seeds are dispersed by
animals especially spiny seeds with
hooks which get attached to the bodies
of animals and are carried to distant
places Examples are Xanthium
Fig 815 and Urena
Some seeds are dispersed when the
fruits burst with sudden jerks The seeds
are scattered far from the parent plant
This happens in the case of castor and
balsam

What you have learnt
All organisms multiply or reproduce their own kind
In plants there are two modes of reproduction asexual and sexual
There are several methods of asexual reproduction such as
fragmentation budding spore formation and vegetative propagation
Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of male and female gametes
In vegetative propagation new plants are produced from different
vegetative parts such as leaves stems and roots
Flower is the reproductive part of a plant
A flower may be unisexual with either the male or the female reproductive
parts
A bisexual flower has both the male and the female reproductive parts
The male gametes are found inside the pollen grains and female gametes
are found in the ovule
Pollination is the process of transfer of pollen grains from the anther of
one flower to the stigma of the same or another flower
Pollination is of two types selfpollination and crosspollination In
selfpollination pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the
stigma of the same flower In crosspollination pollen grains are
transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower
of the same kind
Pollination takes place in plants with the help of wind water and insects
The fusion of male and female gametes is called fertilisation
Fertilised egg is called zygote Zygote develops into an embryo
Fruit is the mature ovary whereas ovule develops into a seed which
contains the developing embryo
Seed dispersal is aided by wind water and animals
Seed dispersal helps the plants to i prevent overcrowding ii avoid
competition for sunlight water and minerals and iii invade new habitats

Electric Current
and its Effects
ou might have tried the game
How steady is your hand
suggested in Chapter 9 of
Class VI If not you may try it out now
Paheli and Boojho had also set up the
game by connecting an electric circuit
as suggested in Class VI They had lots
of fun trying it out with their families
and friends They enjoyed it so much
that they decided to suggest it to a
cousin of theirs who stayed in a
different town So Paheli made a neat
drawing showing how the various
electric components were to be
connected Fig101
Fig 101 Setup to check how steady
your hand is
Can you draw this circuit
conveniently It made Boojho wonder if
there was an easier way to represent
these electric components
101 SYMBOLS OF ELECTRIC
COMPONENTS
Some common electric components can
be represented by symbols In Table 101
some electric components and their
symbols are shown You may come
across different symbols for these
components in different books However
in this book we shall be using the
symbols shown here
Look at the symbols carefully In the
symbol for the electric cell notice that
there is a longer line and a shorter but
thicker parallel line Do you recall that
an electric cell has a positive terminal
and a negative terminal In the symbol
of the electric cell the longer line
represents the positive terminal and the
thicker shorter line represents the
negative terminal
For a switch the ON position and
the OFF position are represented by the
symbols as shown The wires used to
connect the various components in a
circuit are represented by lines
In Table 101 a battery and its
symbol are also shown Do you know
what a battery is Look at the symbol of
a battery Can you make out what a
battery could be For some of the
activities we may need more than one
cell So we connect two or more cells
together as shown in Fig102 Notice

Many devices such as torches
transistors toys TV remote controls use
batteries However in some of these
devices the electric cells are not always
placed one after the other as shown in
Fig 102 Sometimes the cells are placed
side by side Then how are the terminals
of the cells connected Look carefully
inside the battery compartment of any
device There is usually a thick wire or
a metal strip connecting the positive
terminal of one cell to the negative
terminal of the next cell Fig103 In
order to help you to place the cells
correctly in the battery compartment
 and  symbols are usually printed
there
How can we connect the cells to
prepare batteries for our activities You
may make a cell holder as shown in

Then why is it called a battery Can
you help them to find the answer to
this question

Make the electric circuit shown in
Fig 107 You used a similar circuit
in Class VI to make an electric bulb
glow Do you remember that the bulb
glows only when the switch is in the
ON position The bulb glows as soon
as the switch is moved to the ON
position
Copy this electric circuit in your
notebook Make also a circuit diagram
of this circuit using symbols for the
various electric components
Is your diagram similar to the one
shown in Fig 108
It is much easier to draw a circuit
diagram using symbols Therefore we
generally represent an electric circuit by
its circuit diagram
Fig 109 shows another circuit
diagram Is it identical to the circuit
diagram shown in Fig108 In which
way is it different
Would the bulb glow in this electric
circuit Recall that the bulb glows only
when the switch is in the ON position
and the electric circuit is closed

electric current passes through it When
the bulb gets fused its filament is

Notice that the key or switch can
be placed anywhere in the circuit
When the switch is in the ON
position the circuit from the
positive terminal of the battery to
the negative terminal is complete
The circuit is then said to be closed
and the current flows throughout
the circuit instantly
When the switch is in the OFF
position the circuit is incomplete
It is said to be open No current
flows through any part of the
circuit
In the bulb there is a thin wire called
the filament which glows when an
Never touch a lighted electric bulb
connected to the mains It may be very
hot and your hand may get burnt
badly Do not experiment with the
electric supply from the mains or a
generator or an inverter You may get
an electric shock which may be
dangerous Use only electric cells for
all the activities suggested here
If the filament of the bulb is broken
would the circuit be complete Would
the bulb still glow
You might have noticed that a
glowing electric bulb become warm Do
you know why
102 HEATING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC

the bulb Now move the electric switch
to the ON position and let the bulb glow
for a minute or so Again touch the bulb
Do you feel any difference After moving
the switch back to the OFF position
touch the bulb again
The wire gets hot when an electric
current passes through it This is the
heating effect of the electric current
Can you think of any electric appliance
where the heating effect of the electric
current is used Make a list of such
appliances
Activity 103
Make a circuit as shown in Fig1010
Take about 10 cm long piece of nichrome
wire and tie it between the nails You
can get nichrome wire from an electric

current in the circuit by moving the
switch to the ON position After a few
You might have seen an electric room
heater or an electric heater used for
cooking All these contain a coil of wire
This coil of wire is called an element
You may have noticed that when these
appliances are switched on after
Boojho could not see element in an
electric iron Paheli told him that
electrical appliances such as
immersion heaters hotplates irons
geysers electric kettles hair dryers
have elements inside them Have you
ever seen the element in any
appliance

Do not keep the switch in the ON
position for a long time otherwise the
cell may become weak very quickly
seconds touch the wire Do not hold it
for a long time Switch off the current
Touch the wire again after a few
minutes
ELECTRIC CURRENT  ITS EFFECTS

connecting to the electric supply their
elements become red hot and give out
heat
The amount of heat produced in a
wire depends on its material length
and thickness Thus for different
requirements the wires of different
materials and different lengths and
thicknesses are used
The wires used for making electric
circuits do not normally become hot On
the other hand the elements of some
electric appliances become so hot that
they are easily visible The filament of
Incandescent electric bulbs Fig 1012 are often used for lighting but they also
give heat It means that a part of electricity consumed is used in producing
heat This is not desirable as it results in the wastage of electricity The fluorescent
tubelights and compact fluorescent lamps CFLs are better electricity efficient
lighting sources Nowadays the use of light emitting diode LED bulbs is
increasing For producing a given intensity of light LED bulbs consume less
electricity as compared to incandescent bulbs or fluorescent tubes or CFLsThus
LED bulbs are much electricity efficient and therefore being preferred
Fig 1013 Electric bulb tubelight CFL and LED
It is advised to use electrical appliances and gadgets which are electricity efficient
Bureau of Indian Standards New Delhi assigns a Standard Mark on products
called ISI mark
which is an assurance of conformity to the specifications
given on the products It is therefore suggested to use ISI mark products
Note Fluorescent tubes and CFLs contain mercury vapour toxic in nature
Therefore damaged fluorescent tubes or CFLs need to be disposed off safely

an electric bulb gets heated to such a
high temperature that it starts glowing
If a large current passes through a
wire the wire may become so hot that it
may even melt and break But is it
possible for a wire to melt and break
Let us check it out

again However replace the cell with a
battery of four cells Also in place of
the nichrome wire tie a thin strand of
steel wool The steel wool is commonly
used for cleaning utensils and is
available in grocery shops If there are
any fans in the room switch them off
Now pass the current through the circuit
for sometime Observe the strand of steel
wool carefully Note what happens Does
the strand of steel wool melt and break
Wires made from some special
materials melt quickly and break when
large electric currents are passed
through them These wires are used for
making electric fuses Fig1014 In all
buildings fuses are inserted in all
electrical circuits There is a maximum
limit on the current which can safely
flow through a circuit If by accident the
current exceeds this safe limit the wires
CAUTION
Never try to investigate an electric fuse
connected to mains circuit on your
own You may however visit an
electric repair shop and compare the
burnt out fuses with the new ones
One reason for excessive currents in
electrical circuits is the direct
touching of wires This may happen if
the insulation on the wires has come
off due to wear and tear This may
cause a short circuit Another reason
for excessive current can be the
connection of many devices to a single
socket This may cause overload in
the circuit You might have read
reports in newspapers about fires
caused by short circuits and
overloads
may become overheated and may cause
fire If a proper fuse is there in the circuit
it will blow off and break the circuit A
fuse is thus a safety device which
ELECTRIC CURRENT  ITS EFFECTS

These days Miniature
circuit breakers MCBs
are increasingly being
used in place of fuses
These are switches which
automatically turn off
when current in a circuit
exceeds the safe limit You
turn them on and the
circuit is once again
complete Look for ISI
mark on MCBs also
Fig 1016 Miniature

CAUTION
Always use proper fuses which have
been specified for particular
applications carrying ISI mark Never
use just any wire or strip of metal in
place of a fuse
prevents damages to electrical circuits
and possible fires
Fuses of different kinds are used
for different purposes Fig 1014 shows
fuses used in our houses Fuses
shown in Fig 1015 are generally used
in electrical appliances
We observed the heating effect of the
electric current and learnt how we use
it to our advantage Does the electric
current have other effects also

compass needle

tray Place a small compass needle
inside it Now connect the free ends of
this wire to an electric cell through a

compass needle is pointing Bring a bar
magnet near the compass needle

What do you observe Does the compass
needle deflect Move the switch back to
the OFF position Does the compass
needle come back to its initial position
Repeat the experiment a few times
What does this experiment indicate
We know that the needle of a compass
is a tiny magnet which points in
northsouth direction When we bring
a magnet close to it the needle gets
deflected We have also seen that
compass needle gets deflected when the
current flows in a nearby wire Can you
connect the two observations When the
current flows through a wire does the
wire behave like a magnet
This is what a scientist called Hans
Christian Oersted Fig 1018 also
wondered He was the first person who
noticed the deflection of compass needle
every time the current was passed
through the wire
So when electric current passes
through a wire it behaves like a magnet
This is the magnetic effect of the electric
current In fact an electric current can
be used to make magnets Do you find
it too surprising Let us try it out
Fig 1019 An electromagnet
Remember not to switch on the
current for more than a few seconds
at a time The electromagnet weakens
the cell quickly if left connected
104 ELECTROMAGNET
Activity 106
Take around 75 cm long piece of
insulated plastic or cloth covered or
enamelled flexible wire and an iron nail
say about 610 cm long Wind the wire
tightly around the nail in the form of a
coil Connect the free ends of the wire
to the terminals of a cell through a switch
as shown in Fig 1019
Place some pins on or near the end
of the nail Now switch on the current
What happens Do the pins cling to the
tip of the nail Switch off the current
Are the pins still clinging to the end of
the nail
The coil in the above activity behaves
like a magnet when electric current flows
through it When the electric current is
switched off the coil generally loses its
magnetism Such coils are called
electromagnets The electromagnets
can be made very strong and can lift
very heavy loads Do you remember the
crane about which you read in Chapter 10
of Class VI The end of such a crane
has a strong electromagnet attached to
it The electromagnets are also used to
separate magnetic material from the
junk Doctors use tiny electromagnets
to take out small pieces of magnetic
material that have accidentally fallen in

105 ELECTRIC BELL
We are quite familiar with an electric bell
It has an electromagnet in it Let us see
how it works
Fig 1020 shows the circuit of an
electric bell It consists of a coil of wire
wound on an iron piece The coil acts
as an electromagnet An iron strip with
a hammer at one end is kept close to
Fig 10 20 Circuit of an electric bell
the electromagnet There is a contact
screw near the iron strip When the iron
strip is in contact with the screw the
current flows through the coil which
becomes an electromagnet It then
pulls the iron strip In the process the
hammer at the end of the strip strikes
the gong of the bell to produce a sound
However when the electromagnet pulls
the iron strip it also breaks the circuit
The current through the coil stops
flowing Will the coil remain an
electromagnet
The coil is no longer an electromagnet
It no longer attracts the iron strip The
iron strip comes back to its original
position and touches the contact screw
again This completes the circuit The
current flows in the coil and the
hammer strikes the gong again This
process is repeated in quick succession
The hammer strikes the gong every time
the circuit is completed This is how
the bell rings

What you have learnt
It is convenient to represent electric components by symbols Using these
an electric circuit can be represented by a circuit diagram
When an electric current flows through a wire the wire gets heated It is
the heating effect of current This effect has many applications
118
Wires made from some special materials melt quickly and break
when large electric currents are passed through them These
materials are used for making electric fuses which prevent fires
and damage to electric appliances
When an electric current flows through a wire it behaves like a
magnet
A current carrying coil of an insulated wire wrapped around a
piece of iron is called an electromagnet
Electromagnets are used in many devices

Think of an explanation
Paheli and Boojho saw a magic trick sometime back The magician placed
an iron box on a stand He then called Boojho and asked him to lift the
box Boojho could easily lift the box Now the magician made a show of
moving his stick around the box while muttering some thing He again
asked Boojho to lift the box This time Boojho could not even move it The
magician again muttered some thing and now Boojho could lift the box
The audience including Paheli and Boojho were very impressed with
the show and felt that the magician had some supernatural powers
However after reading this chapter Paheli is wondering if the trick was
indeed some magic or some science was involved Can you guess what
science might be involved

Any polished or a shiny surface can
act as a mirror What happens when
light falls on a mirror
You have learnt in Class VI that a
mirror changes the direction of light that
falls on it This change of direction by a
mirror is called reflection of light Can
you recall the activity in which you got
the light of a torch reflected from a
mirror Let us perform a similar activity
Activity 111
Fig 113 Reflection of objects in water
at a lighted candle first through
a straight pipe and then through
a bent pipe Fig 112 Why was
Boojho not able to see the candle
flame through a bent pipe
This activity showed that
light travels along straight lines
How can we change the path
of light Do you know what
happens when light falls on a
polished or a shiny surface
Take a torch Cover its glass with a chart
paper which has three narrow slits as
shown in Fig 115 Spread a sheet of
Paheli remembers the story of the lion and the
rabbit from the Panchtantra in which the
rabbit fooled the lion by showing him his
reflection in water Fig 114
112 REFLECTION OF LIGHT
One way to change the direction
of light is to let it fall on a shiny
surface For example a shining
stainless steel plate or a shining
steel spoon can change the
direction of light The surface of
water can also act like a mirror
and change the path of light
Have you ever seen the reflection
of trees or buildings in water
Fig 113
Fig 114 Reflection of the lion in water
124
Look into the mirror along the
direction of the reflected light Do you
see the slits in the mirror This is the
image of the slits
This activity shows how light gets
reflected from a plane mirror
Let us play around with the images
formed in mirrors and know a little more
about them
Activity 112
CAUTION

chart paper on a smooth wooden board
Fix a plane mirror strip vertically on the
chart paper Fig 115 Now direct the
beam of light on the mirror from the
torch with slits Place the torch in such
a way that its light is seen along the
chart paper on the board Now adjust
its position so that the light from the
torch strikes the plane mirror at an
angle Fig 115
Does the mirror change the direction
of light that falls on it Now move the
torch slightly to either side Do you find
any change in the direction of reflected
light
Paheli wants to know what
makes things visible to us
Boojho thinks that objects are
visible only when light reflected
from them reaches our eyes Do
you agree with him
Handle the lighted candle with care
It is better if this activity is performed
in the presence of a teacher or an elder
person
Place a lighted candle in front of a plane
mirror Try to see the flame of the candle
in the mirror It appears as if a similar
candle is placed behind the mirror The
candle which appears behind the
mirror is the image of the candle formed
by the mirror Fig 116 The candle
itself is the object
Now move the candle to different
positions in front of the mirror Observe
the image in each case

Boojho noted in his notebook Is
it not surprising that my image is
of the same size as me whether
the mirror is small or large
Was the image upright in each case
Did the flame appear on top of the candle
as in the object Such an image is called
erect An image formed by a plane
mirror is erect and of the same size as
the object
Now place a vertical screen behind
the mirror Try to obtain the image of
the candle on this screen Can you get
the image on the screen Now place the
screen in front of the mirror Can you
get the image on the screen now You
will find that the image of the candle
cannot be obtained on the screen in
either case
What about the distance of the image
from mirror Let us perform another
activity

line in the middle of the paper Fix a
plane mirror vertically on this line Place
any small object such as a pencil
sharpner at the boundary of the third
square counting from the mirror
Fig 117 Note the position of the
image Now shift the object to the
boundary of the fourth square Again
note the position of the image Did you
find any relation between the distance
of the image from the mirror and that of
the object in front of it
Fig 117 Locating image in a plane mirror
Paheli made a note in her notebook
In a plane mirror the image is
formed behind the mirror It is erect
of the same size and is at the same
distance from the mirror as the
object is in front of it
126
You will find that the image
is at the same distance behind
the mirror as the object is in front
of it Now verify this by placing
the object anywhere on the chart
paper

Which ear does your hand touch in your
image Observe carefully You will find
that in the mirror the right appears left
and the left appears right Note that
only sides are interchanged the image
does not appear upside down

understand
why the word AMBULANCE is written
as in Fig 119  When the driver of a
vehicle ahead of an ambulance looks in

114 PLAYING WITH SPHERICAL
MIRRORS
Paheli and Boojho were waiting for their
dinner Boojho lifted a stainless steel
plate and saw his image in it Oh This
plate acts as a plane mirror My image
is erect and is of the same size Paheli
saw her image using the back of a steel
spoon Boojho look here I can also see
my erect image though it is smaller in
size This spoon also acts as a mirror of
some kind said Paheli
You can also use a spoon or any
curved shining surface to see your
image
Now look at your image using the
inner side of the spoon This time you
may find that your image is erect and
larger in size If you increase the distance
of the spoon from your face you may
see your image inverted Fig 1111 You
can also compare the image of your pen
or pencil instead of your face
Activity 115
Take a stainless steel spoon Bring the
outer side of the spoon near your face
and look into it Do you see your image
in it Fig 1110 Is this image different
from what you see in a plane mirror Is
this image erect Is the size of the image
the same smaller or larger
Fig 1111 Image from the inner side of a
spoon
The curved shining surface of a spoon
acts as a mirror The most common
example of a curved mirror is a spherical
mirror
If the reflecting surface of a spherical
mirror is concave it is called a concave
mirror If the reflecting surface is convex
then it is a convex mirror Fig 1112

We know that the image of an object
formed by a plane mirror cannot be
obtained on a screen Let us investigate
if it is also true for the image formed by
a concave mirror
Activity 116
CAUTION
You will conduct Activity 116 in the
sunlight Be careful never look
directly towards the Sun or its image
as it may damage your eyes You may
look at the image of the Sun when it
is thrown on a screen or a wall
Take a concave mirror Hold it facing
the Sun Try to get the light reflected by
the mirror on a sheet of paper Adjust
the distance of the paper until you get a
sharp bright spot on it Fig 1114 Hold
the mirror and the sheet of paper steady
for a few minutes Does the paper start
burning
This bright spot is in fact the image
of the Sun Notice that this image is
formed on a screen An image formed
on a screen is called a real image
Recollect that in Activity 112 the image
formed by a plane mirror could not be
obtained on a screen Such an image is
called a virtual image
Now let us try to obtain on the screen
the image of a candle flame formed by a
concave mirror

a sharp image of the flame is obtained
Make sure that the screen does not
Fig 1116 Virtual image formed by a concave
mirror
obstruct the light from the candle falling
on the mirror Is this image real or
virtual Is it of the same size as the flame
Now move the candle towards the
mirror and place it at different distances
from it In each case try to obtain the
image on the screen Record your
observation in Table 111 Is it possible
to obtain the image on the screen when
the candle is too close to the mirror
Fig 1116
We see that the image formed by a
concave mirror can be smaller or larger
in size than the object The image may
also be real or virtual
Concave mirrors are used for many
purposes You might have seen doctors
using concave mirrors for examining
eyes ears nose and throat Concave
mirrors are also used by dentists
to see an enlarged image of the teeth
Fig 1117 The reflectors of torches
headlights of cars and scooters are
concave in shape Fig 1118

if the bell is also a kind of spherical
mirror Can you recognise the type of
the mirror

You might have seen a magnifying glass
It is used to read very small print
Fig 1121 You might have also used
it to observe the body parts of a

magnifying glass is actually a type of a lens
Lenses are widely used in spectacles
telescopes and microscopes Try to add
a few more uses of lenses to this list
Get some lenses Touch and feel
them Can you find some difference just
by touching Those lenses which feel
thicker in the middle than at the edges

CAUTION
It is dangerous to look through a lens
at the Sun or a bright light You
should also be careful not to focus
sunlight with a convex lens on any
part of your body

the paper till you get a bright spot on
the paper Hold the lens and the paper
in this position for a few minutes Does
the paper begin to burn
Now replace the convex lens with a
concave lens Do you see a bright spot
A convex lens converges bends
inward the light generally falling on it

converging lens On the other hand a
concave lens diverges bends outward

ne evening Boojho entered the
park with an elderly person He
introduced him to his friends
Prof Ahmad was a scientist working in
the university The children started
playing while Prof Ahmad sat on a
bench in the corner He was tired as he
had participated in the golden jubilee
celebrations of the town After a while
the children also came and sat around
him They wanted to know about the
celebrations Prof Ahmad told them that
after the cultural programme the
senior people discussed the towns
unemployment problem A plan was
proposed to put up a factory by clearing
an area of the forest just outside the
town This would give the increasing
population of the town a chance to get
jobs The children were very surprised
when Prof Ahmad told them that many
people had objected to this idea
Fig 121 A view of a forest
This is because the forests serve as
green lungs and water purifying systems
in nature Prof Ahmad explained The
children were confused Prof Ahmad
realised that the children had not visited
a forest The children also wanted to
know more about the forest so they
decided to visit it with Prof Ahmad
121 VISIT TO A FOREST
One Sunday morning the children
packed a few things like a knife a hand
lens a stick a notebook and walked
together through a forest trail near a
village On their way they met Tibu a
young boy of their age group of nearby
village who was taking cattle for grazing
along with his aunt He was very agile
running here and there to keep the herd
together When he saw the children
Tibu also started walking along with
them while his aunt went on a different
path As soon as they entered the forest
Tibu raised his hand and signalled them
to keep quiet because noise could
disturb the animals living in the forest
Tibu then took them to a place at a
height to show them the broad view of
the forest Children were surprised
because they could not see any land
Fig 121 The different treetops had
formed green cover over the land However
the cover was not uniformly green The
142
environment was peaceful and a cool
breeze was blowing This made children
quite fresh and happy
While coming down they got excited
on hearing a sudden sound of birds and
some noise from the top branches of the
trees Tibu told them to relax since it
was a normal phenomenon here
Because of the childrens presence some
monkeys had climbed higher up on the
trees where they disturbed the birds
Animals often give this type of warning
call to alert other animals Tibu also told
that many other animals like boar
bison jackals porcupine elephants live
in the deeper areas of the forest
Fig 122 Prof Ahmad cautioned
children that they should not go deep
into the forest
Boojho and Paheli remembered that
they have studied about forests as

Observe the various things in your home
and make a list of those which are made
from material which may have been
obtained from the forest
You might have many wooden items
on your list like plywood fuel wood

spices fodder for animals and medicinal
plants are also some of the products
which we get from the forest Fig 125

from plants try to fill Table 121 One

Sheila wondered who would have
planted these trees Prof Ahmad replied
that in nature trees produce enough
seeds The forest floor provides
favourable conditions for them to
germinate and develop into seedlings
Honey
Wooden
statue
Sealing wax
Catechu
Gum
Prof Ahmad asked children to look
up and observe how the branches of the
tall trees look like a roof over the other
plants in the forest He told them that
this is called a canopy Fig 127
Activity 122
Visit a forest or a park in your
neighbourhood Observe the trees and
try to identify them You can take the
help of some elders or books on trees
List the characteristics of the trees that
you observe such as the height shape
of leaves crown flowers and fruits Also
draw the crowns of some trees
Prof Ahmad pointed out that trees
had crowns of different types and sizes
These had created different horizontal
layers in the forest These are known as
understoreys Fig 127 Giant and tall
trees constituted the top layer followed
by shrubs and tall grasses and herbs
formed the lowest layer

Understorey
Fig 127 Canopy and under storeys in a forest
Would we see similar kind of trees
in every forest  asked Boojho
Prof Ahmad said No due to different
climatic conditions there are variations
in the types of trees and other plants
The types of animals also differ from
forest to forest
A few children were busy watching
beautiful butterflies fluttering here and
there on the flowers of shrubs and herbs
Fig 128 Forest floor
They had a close look at the bushes
While doing that their hair and clothes
had seeds and thorns clinging to them
They came across numerous insects
spiders squirrels ants and various
other small animals on the bark of the
trees plant leaves and on decaying
leaves on the forest floor Fig 128 They
started making sketches of these
creatures The forest floor seemed dark
coloured and was covered with a layer
of dead and decaying leaves fruits
seeds twigs and small herbs The
decaying matter was moist and warm
Children picked up various seeds and
leaves for their collection Walking over
the dead leaf layer on the forest floor
was like walking over a spongy carpet
Is the decaying matter always warm
Prof Ahmad suggested that the children
could perform an activity to get an
answer to this question
146
Activity 123
Dig a small pit Put vegetable waste and
leaves in it Cover them with soil Add
some water After three days remove the
upper layer of the soil Does the pit feel
warm inside
Paheli asked There are so many
trees here Also there are many forest
like this What difference will it make if
we cut some trees for a factory
Prof Ahmad said You have read
about autotrophs heterotrophs and
saprotrophs You have learnt how green
plants produce food All animals
whether herbivores or carnivores
depend ultimately on plants for food
Organisms which feed on plants often
get eaten by other organisms and so
on For example grass is eaten by
insects which in turn is taken by the
frog The frog is consumed by snakes
This is said to form a food chain
Grass  insects  frog  snake  eagle
Many food chains can be found in the
forest All food chains are linked If any
one food chain is disturbed it affects
other food chains Every part of the
forest is dependent on the other parts
If we remove one component say trees
all other components would be affected

Carbon dioxide

Prof Ahmad asked children to pick
up leaves from the forest floor and
observe them under a hand lens They
found tiny mushrooms over the
decaying leaves They also saw an army
of tiny insects millipedes ants and
beetle on them They were wondering
how these organisms live there Prof Ahmad
explained that apart from these animals
which are easily seen there are several
organisms and microorganisms that
live in the soil Paheli wondered what
mushroom and other microorganisms
eat Prof Ahmad replied that they feed
upon the dead plant and animal tissues
and convert them into a dark coloured
substance called humus
In which layer of the soil would you
find humus What is its importance to
the soil
The microorganisms which convert
the dead plants and animals to humus
are known as decomposers These
microorganisms play an important role
in the forest Soon Paheli removed some
dead leaves and discovered under them
a layer of humus on forest floor The
presence of humus ensures that the
nutrients of the dead plants and
animals are released into the soil From
there these nutrients are again absorbed
by the roots of the living plants What
happens if an animal dies in the forest
Sheila asked Tibu replied the dead
animals become food for vultures crows
jackals and insects In this way the
nutrients are cycled So nothing goes
waste in a forest Fig 129
Paheli reminded Prof Ahmad that he
had not explained why forests are called
green lungs Prof Ahmad explained that
plants release oxygen through the
process of photosynthesis The plants
help to provide oxygen for animal
respiration They also maintain the
Paheli reminded their
friends that they have
studied photosynthesis in
Chapter 1
Fig 1210 Balance of oxygen and carbon
dioxide
balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere Fig 1210 That is
why forests are called lungs
The children saw clouds forming in
the sky Boojho recalled what he had
learnt about the water cycle in Class VI
Trees take in water from their roots and
release water vapour into the air
through evaporation
If there were fewer trees how will the
water cycle be affected
Tibu told them that the forest is not
just home to plants and animals Many
people also live in the forest Some of
148
them may belong to different tribes Tibu
explained that these people depend
mostly on the forests The forest provides
them with food shelter water and
medicines They have traditional
knowledge about many medicinal plants
in the forest
While Boojho was drinking water
from a small stream he saw some deer
crossing the stream Fig 1211 They
disappeared into the bushes The dense
bushes and the tall grass provide
animals with the food and shelter They
showed the children droppings of some
animals and explained the difference
between various types of droppings
Prof Ahmad informed them that the
forest officers could recognise the
presence of some animals in the forest
by their droppings and footprints
Boojho called every one and showed
them a large decaying heap of animal
dropping Several beetles and grubs
were feeding on the heap and a bunch
of seedlings was sprouting These
seedlings are of the herbs and shrubs
Fig 1211 Deer in a forest
Fig 1212 A sapling on a wall
Paheli remembered that she
saw a Pipal sapling on the
sidewall in her school Can you
help her to understand how this
would have happened
also protect them from carnivores that
live in the forest
Tibu then started looking closely at
the forest floor Soon he called and
The animals also disperse the seeds of
certain plants and help the forest to grow
and regenerate The decaying animal
dung also provides nutrients to the
seedlings to grow said Prof Ahmad
After listening to this Boojho noted
in his notebook By harbouring greater
variety of plants the forest provides
greater opportunities for food and
habitat for the herbivores Larger
number of herbivores means increased
availability of food for a variety of

carnivores The wide variety of animals
helps the forest to regenerate and grow
Decomposers help in maintaining the
supply of nutrients to the growing plants
in the forest Therefore the forest is a
dynamic living entity  full of life and
vitality
It was about afternoon and the
children wanted to go back Tibu
suggested another route for going back
While they were going back it started
raining However surprisingly they saw
that the raindrops were not hitting the
forest floor directly The uppermost layer
of the forest canopy intercepted the flow
of raindrops and most of the water was
coming down through the branches and
the stems of the trees From the leaves it
150
was dripping slowly over branches of the
shrubs and herbs Fig 1213 They
found that the ground was still dry After
about half an hour the rain stopped
They noticed that the layer of dead
leaves over the forest floor appeared wet
now But water did not stagnate in the
forest
Boojho thought that if it had rained
so heavily in his town it would have
flooded the drains and roads
What would happen if it rains heavily
in your town
Prof Ahmad told them that the forest
also acts as a natural absorber of
rainwater and allows it to seep It helps
maintain the water table throughout the
year Forests not only help in controlling
floods but also help maintain the flow
of water in the streams so that we get a
steady supply of water On the other
hand if trees are not present rain hits
the ground directly and may flood the
area around it Heavy rain may also
damages the soil Roots of trees normally
bind the soil together but in their
absence the soil is washed away or
eroded
The children spent an hour at Tibus
village on their way back The weather
of the village was quite pleasant Villagers
told them that due to the surrounding
forest they receive good rainfall The air
also remained cool Noise pollution too
is less because the forest absorbs the
noise of the nearby highway
The children learnt about the history
of the village It surprised them that the
villages and the agricultural fields of
that area were created after clearing the
forest about sixty years ago Tibus
grandfather told them that when he was
young the village was not as large as it
was now It was also surrounded
by forests Construction of roads
buildings industrial development and
increasing demand of wood created
pressure on the forests and it started
vanishing He was not happy that the
forest adjoining their village is not
regenerating and is on the verge of
disappearing due to overgrazing of
animals and indiscriminate felling of
trees Prof Ahmad said that if we did
things wisely we could preserve forests
and environment as well as have
development
Children prepared a few pictures to
show the consequences of such an
event
At the end of the visit Prof Ahmad
asked children to sum up the
importance of forests The children
wrote Forests provide us with oxygen
They protect soil and provide habitat to
a large number of animals Forests
help in bringing good rainfall in
neighbouring areas They are a source
of medicinal plants timber and many
other useful products We must preserve

What you have learnt
We get various products from the forests surrounding us
Forest is a system comprising various plants animals and
microorganisms
In a forest trees form the uppermost layer followed by shrubs
The herbs form the lowest layer of vegetation
Different layers of vegetation provide food and shelter for animals
birds and insects
The various components of the forest are interdependent on one
another
The forest keeps on growing and changing and can regenerate
In the forest there is interaction between soil water air and
living organisms
Forests protect the soil from erosion
Soil helps forests to grow and regenerate
Forests are the lifeline for the forestdwelling communities
Forests influence climate water cycle and air quality

Wastewater Story
All of us use water in our homes and
make it dirty
Dirty Are you surprised
Rich in lather mixed with oil black
brown water that goes down the drains
from sinks showers toilets laundries
is dirty It is called wastewater This
used water should not be wasted We
must clean it up by removing pollutants
Have you ever thought where the
wastewater goes and what happens to it
131 WATER OUR LIFELINE
Clean water is a basic need of human
being Let us make a mindmap of the
many uses of clean water

Clean water that is fit
for use is unfortunately
not available to all It has
been reported that more
than one billion of people
have no access to safe
drinking water This accounts for a large
number of waterrelated diseases and
even deaths People even children walk
for several kilometres to collect clean
water Is it not a serious matter for
human dignity
The increasing scarcity of freshwater
due to population growth pollution
industrial developmentmismanagement
and other factors Realising the urgency
of the situation on the World Water Day
on 22 March 2005 the General
Assembly of the United Nations
proclaimed the period 2005 2015 as the
International Decade for action on
Water for life All efforts made during
this decade aim to reduce by half the
number of people who do not have
access to safe drinking water
There has been perceptible progress
in the direction of the aim but still there
is a lot to achieve
Cleaning of water is a process of
removing pollutants before it enters a
water body or is reused This process of
wastewater treatment is commonly
156
known as Sewage Treatment It takes
place in several stages
132 WHAT IS SEWAGE
Sewage is wastewater released by homes
industries hospitals offices and other
users It also includes rainwater that has
run down the street during a storm or
heavy rain The water that washes off
roads and rooftops carries harmful
substances with it Sewage is a liquid
waste Most of it is water which has
dissolved and suspended impurities
Activity 132
Locate an open drain near your home
school or on the roadside and inspect
water flowing through it
Record colour odour and any other
observation Discuss with your friends
and your teacher and fill up the
following Table 131
We know that sewage is a complex
mixture containing suspended solids
organic and inorganic impurities
nutrients saprophytes and disease
causing bacteria and other microbes
These include the following
Organic impurities  Human faeces
animal waste
oil urea urine
pesticides
herbicides fruit
and vegetable
waste etc
Inorganic impurities  Nitrates
Phosphates
metals
Nutrients
 Phosphorus
and Nitrogen
Bacteria
 Such as vibrio
cholera which
causes cholera
and salmonella
paratyphi which
causes typhoid
Other microbes
 Such as
protozones
which cause
dysentery

sewers forming the sewerage It is like
a transport system that carries sewage
from the point of being produced to the
point of disposal ie treatment plant
Manholes are located at every 50 m
to 60 m in the sewerage at the junction
of two or more sewers and at points
where there is a change in direction
Activity 133
Study the sewage route in your home
schoolbuilding Do the following
 Make a line diagram of the sewage
route
 Walk down the street or survey the
campus to find the number of
manholes
 If possible observe open drain and
record which living organisms are
found in and around it
In case you do not have a sewerage
system in your locality find out how
sewage is being disposed off
Treatment of polluted water
Perform the following activity It will help
you understand the processes that take
place at the wastewater treatment plant
Activity 134
Divide yourself into groups to perform
the activity Record observations at each
stage
 Fill a large glass jar 34 full of water
Add some dirty organic matter such
as grass pieces or orange peels a
small amount of detergent and a few
drops of an ink or any colour
158
Cap the jar shake it well and let the
mixture stand in the sun for two
days
After two days shake the mixture
and pour a small sample into test
tube Label this test tube Before
treatment Sample 1 How does it
smell
Use an aerator from an aquarium to
bubble air through the sample in the
glass jar Allow several hours for
aeration leave the aerator attached
overnight If you do not have an
aerator use a mechanical stirrer or
a mixer You may have to stir it
several times
The next day when aeration is
complete pour another sample into
a second test tube Label it as After
aeration Sample 2
Fold a piece of filter paper to form a
cone Wet the paper with tap water
and then insert the cone in a funnel
Mount the funnel on a support
as you have learnt in Class VI
Place layers of sand fine gravel and
finally medium gravel in the funnel
Fig 132 An actual filtration plant
does not use filter paper but the sand
filter is several metres deep
Pour the remaining aerated liquid
through the filter into the beakers
Do not allow the liquid to spill over
the filter If the filtered liquid is not
clear filter it a few times till you get
clear water
Pour a sample of the filtered water
into a third test tube labelled
Filtered Sample 3
1 Wastewater is passed through bar
screens Large objects like rags
sticks cans plastic packets napkins
are removed Fig 133
Fig 132 Filtration process
Pour another sample of the filtered
water into a fourth test tube Add a
small piece of a chlorine tablet Mix
well until the water is clear Label the
test tube Chlorinated Sample 4
 Observe carefully the samples in all
the test tubes Do not taste Just
smell them
Now answer the following questions
a What changes did you observe in the
appearance of the liquid after
aeration
b Did aeration change the odour
c What was removed by the sand filter
d Did chlorine remove the colour
e Did chlorine have an odour Was it
worse than that of the wastewater
Fig 133 Bar screen
2 Water then goes to a grit and sand
removal tank The speed of the
incoming wastewater is decreased to
allow sand grit and pebbles to settle
down Fig 134

Treatment of wastewater involves
physical chemical and biological
processes which remove physical
chemical and biological matter that
contaminates the wastewater

a large tank which is sloped towards
the middle Solids like faeces settle
at the bottom and are removed with

Fig 135 Water clarifier
a scraper This is the sludge A
skimmer removes the floatable solids
like oil and grease Water so cleared
is called clarified water Fig 135
The sludge is transferred to a
separate tank where it is decomposed
by the anaerobic bacteria The biogas
produced in the process can be used as
fuel or can be used to produce electricity
4 Air is pumped into the clarified water
to help aerobic bacteria to grow
Bacteria consume human waste food
waste soaps and other unwanted
matter still remaining in clarified
water Fig 136
After several hours the suspended
microbes settle at the bottom of the tank
as activated sludge The water is then
removed from the top
The activated sludge is about 97
water The water is removed by sand
drying beds or machines Dried sludge
is used as manure returning organic
matter and nutrients to the soil
The treated water has a very low level
of organic material and suspended
matter It is discharged into a sea a river
or into the ground Nature cleans it up
further Sometimes it may be necessary
to disinfect water with chemicals like
chlorine and ozone before releasing it
into the distribution system

type of waste and quantity of waste
produced Often we have been repelled
by offensive smell The sight of open
drains is disgusting The situation
worsens in the rainy season when the
drains start overflowing We have to
wade through the mud pools on the
roads Most unhygienic and unsanitary
conditions prevail Flies mosquitoes and
other insects breed in it
You can be an enlightened citizen
and approach the municipality or the
gram panchayat Insist that the open
drains be covered If the sewage of
any particular house makes the
neighbourhood dirty you should
Chemicals like paints solvents
insecticides motor oil medicines
may kill microbes that help purify
water So do not throw them down
the drain
Used tealeaves solid food remains
soft toys cotton sanitary towels etc
should also be thrown in the dustbin

drains They do not allow free flow
of oxygen This hampers the

135 BETTER HOUSEKEEPING
PRACTICES
One of the ways to minimise or eliminate
waste and pollutants at their source is
to see what you are releasing down the
drain
 Cooking oil and fats should not be
thrown down the drain They can
harden and block the pipes In an
open drain the fats clog the soil pores
reducing its effectiveness in filtering
water Throw oil and fats in the
dustbin
Fig 137 Do not throw everything in the sink
WASTEWATER STORY
161
In the year 2016 the Government of India has initiated a new mission known as
Swachh Bharat under which a lot of drives such as proper sewage disposal
and providing toilets for everyone have been started
Vermiprocessing toilet
A design of a toilet in which humans excreta is treated by earthworms has been
tested in India It has been found to be a novel low wateruse toilet for safe
processing of human waste The operation of the toilet is very simple and hygienic
The human excreta is completely converted to vermi cakes  a resource much
needed for soil
136 SANITATION  DISEASE
Poor sanitation and contaminated
drinking water is the cause of a large
number of diseases
Let us look at our own country A
vast number of our people are still
without sewerage facilities Where do
they relieve themselves
A very large fraction of our people
defecates in the open on dry riverbeds
on railway tracks near fields and many
a time directly in water Untreated
human excreta is a health hazard It
may cause water pollution and soil
pollution Both the surface water and
groundwater get polluted Groundwater
is a source of water for wells tubewells
springs and many rivers Thus it
becomes the most common route for
water borne diseases They include
cholera typhoid polio meningitis
hepatitis and dysentery
Bhoojo wants to know how
sewage is disposed of in an
aeroplane
137 ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENT
FOR SEWAGE DISPOSAL
To improve sanitation low cost onsite
sewage disposal systems are being
encouraged Examples are septic tanks
chemical toilets composting pits Septic
tanks are suitable for places where there
is no sewerage system for hospitals
isolated buildings or a cluster of 4 to 5
houses
Some organisations offer hygienic
onsite human waste disposal
technology These toilets do not require
scavenging Excreta from the toilet seats
flow through covered drains into a
biogas plant The biogas produced is
used as a source of energy
138 SANITATION AT PUBLIC PLACES
In our country fairs are organised
periodically A large number of people
participate in them In the same way
railway stations bus depots airports
hospitals are very busy places
Thousands of people visit them daily
Large amount of waste is generated
162
here It must be disposed of properly
otherwise epidemics could break out
The government has laid down
certain standards of sanitation but
unfortunately they are not strictly
enforced
However all of us can contribute in
maintaining sanitation at public places
We should not scatter litter anywhere
If there is no dustbin in sight we should
carry the litter home and throw it in the
dustbin
must realise your responsibility in
maintaining the water sources in a
healthy state Adopting good sanitation
practices should be our way of life As
an agent of change your individual
initiative will make a great difference
Influence others with your energy ideas
and optimism A lot can be done if people
work together There is great power in
collective action
Conclusion
No one need to wait for anyone else
to adopt a humane and enlightened
course of action
We all have a role to play in keeping our
environment clean and healthy You

What you have learnt
Used water is wastewater Wastewater could be reused
Wastewater is generated in homes industries agricultural fields and in
other human activities This is called sewage
Sewage is a liquid waste which causes water and soil pollution
Wastewater is treated in a sewage treatment plant
Treatment plants reduce pollutants in wastewater to a level where nature
can take care of it
Where underground sewerage systems and refuse disposal systems are
not available the low cost onsite sanitation system can be adopted
Byproducts of wastewater treatment are sludge and biogas
Open drain system is a breeding place for flies mosquitoes and organisms
which cause diseases
We should not defecate in the open It is possible to have safe disposal of
excreta by low cost methods
