Exploring
Substances: Acidic,
Basic, and Neutral
On 28 February, the school hosted a science fair to celebrate
National Science Day. At the entry gate, siblings Ashwin and
Keerthi were greeted with a white sheet of paper. They were
curious to know why a white sheet of paper was given to them!
A few steps ahead, there was a volunteer spraying a liquid
on these sheets of paper. The siblings also got their white sheets
sprayed. To their surprise, the words ‘Welcome to the Wonderful
World of Science’ appeared on the papers the moment the liquid
was sprayed (Fig. 2.1). They were excited and eager to know how
this happened and the reason behind it.
Their curiosity was partly satisﬁed at the ‘Colourful World
of Substances’ stall. They saw many activities showing colour
changes on mixing diﬀerent substances. They decided to explore
these changes further. Let us join them on this learning adventure.

2.1.1 Litmus as an indicator
Activity 2.1: Let us explore
 Collect samples of lemon juice, soap solution, amla juice,
tamarind water, vinegar, baking soda solution, lime water,
tap water, washing powder solution, sugar solution, and salt
solution.
 Take a strip of blue litmus paper
and cut it into small pieces.
 Spread these pieces on a clean
and dry white tile.
 Using a dropper, put one drop of
each of the samples, one-by-one,
on these litmus paper pieces, as
shown in Fig. 2.2a.

How to prepare lime water?
Do not confuse lime water with the word lime, which is a fruit
similar to lemon.
Lime water (solution of calcium hydroxide in water) can be
easily prepared by mixing lime (chuna, i.e. calcium oxide) in water
and leaving it undisturbed for some time, say an hour. Filter the
liquid into another container and use it as lime water.

Now, let us analyse Table 2.1 and sort the samples into
three groups as follows —
 Group A with samples that turn the blue litmus paper to red.
 Group B with samples that turn the red litmus paper to blue.
 Group C with samples that do not aﬀect either of the two
litmus papers.

I am curious to know — what are these
red and blue litmus paper strips made of?
Why do they change colour when drops
of some samples are put on them?

Fig. 2.3: Blue and red litmus
paper strips
Let us ﬁnd out!
Litmus is a natural substance obtained from lichens. It is
available both as a solution and in the form of paper strips,
known as litmus paper. The litmus paper is available in two
colours—blue and red, as shown in Fig. 2.3.
Substances that turn blue litmus paper to red are acidic in
nature, while those that turn red litmus paper to blue are basic
in nature. Since litmus shows diﬀerent colours in acidic and basic
solutions, it is called an acid-base indicator.
Some other substances, both natural and synthetic, can
also be used as indicators. Synthetic indicators are made in
laboratories, and you will learn more about them in higher
grades.

HOLISTIC LENS
Lichens
Lichens are formed by the association of two
living organisms, a fungus and an alga. They grow
on rocks and trees in regions that have abundant
rainfall and clean air. Do you ﬁnd lichens on trees
in your neighbourhood?

Now, let us classify the substances sorted in Group A, Group B,
and Group C in Table 2.2.
 The substances in Group A, such as lemon juice, amla juice,
tamarind water, and vinegar turned the blue litmus paper to
red, implying that these substances are acidic in nature.
 The substances in Group B, such as soap solution, baking
soda solution, lime water, and washing powder solution
turned the red litmus paper to blue. Hence, these substances
are basic in nature.
 The substances in Group C, such as tap water, sugar solution,
and salt solution, did not change the colour of either litmus
paper. Can you predict their nature?
These substances are said to be neutral because they are
neither acidic nor basic.

11
Are all the substances in Group A of Table 2.2 edible? Have you
ever tasted these edible substances? Can you recall their taste?
You will ﬁnd that all these substances taste sour. Thus, we can
say that substances that taste sour tend to contain acids and are
acidic in nature.
Caution — Do not taste anything until asked to do so. Do not taste any
unknown substance.

Some common edible substances and the names of the most
common acids present in them are given in Fig. 2.4.

Now, let us take one of the substances — baking soda
solution — from Group B. Rub the baking soda solution between
your ﬁngers. What do you observe?
It feels soapy or slippery. Basic substances are generally
slippery to touch.
Also, bases generally taste bitter, but Now, I can check
everything that tastes bitter may not the nature of ﬂoor
contain a base. For example, bitter gourd cleaning liquid using
(karela) possesses a bitter taste but is not an indicator!
basic in nature.
If litmus is not available, are there
some other natural substances
that can serve as acid-base
indicators?

2.1.2 Red rose as an indicator
You might have observed many coloured ﬂowers in your
surroundings. Try making your indicators using these ﬂowers.
Activity 2.3: Let us prepare
 Collect some fallen petals of
red roses available in your
surroundings (Fig. 2.5). It is
advised not to pluck ﬂowers. You
may pick petals or ﬂowers fallen
on the ground.
 Take a ﬁstful of the collected
petals of red roses and wash
them with water.

 Place them in a glass tumbler.
 Pour some hot water into the glass tumbler to ensure that
the crushed ﬂower petals are completely immersed.
Caution — Perform this step under the supervision of an adult.

 Cover the glass tumbler with a lid. Wait for 5 – 10 minutes till
the water becomes coloured (Fig. 2.6), and ﬁlter it.

Discuss your observations with your classmates.
 Are the samples that change the colour of the ﬂower extract
to a shade of red the same as those that changed the colour
of blue litmus paper to red? (Group A, Table 2.2)
 Are the samples that change the colour of the ﬂower extract
to a shade of green the same as those that changed the colour
of red litmus paper to blue? (Group B, Table 2.2)
 Are the samples that do not change the colour of the ﬂower
extract the same as those that did not change the colour of
red and blue litmus papers? (Group C, Table 2.2)
From the above activity, we can conclude that the red rose
extract can also be used to test the nature of the substances;
hence, it is another example of an acid-base indicator. We can
conclude that the red rose extract seems to give red colour in an
acidic solution and green colour in a basic solution.
Can you now ﬁll in the nature of the substances in Table 2.3?

Chapter 2.indd 13
4/3/2025 4:50:47 PM
We are sure that you will be excited about the above results.
You may repeat the process of preparing the extract and testing
substances with some vegetables, fruits, or ﬂowers, such as
beetroot, purple cabbage, turmeric, Indian blackberry (jamun),
and red hibiscus (gudhal) ﬂower. They can also act as acid-base
indicators.

FASCINATING FACTS
Hydrangea is a plant that
grows in cooler climates in
the Himalayan region and the
North-eastern states. It gives
ﬂowers of diﬀerent colours,
depending on the nature of the
soil. Acidic soil produces bluecoloured ﬂowers, whereas
Hydrangea ﬂowers
in basic soil, the ﬂowers are
pink or red. Can gardeners alter the colour of hydrangea ﬂowers by
adjusting the acidic or basic nature of the soil?

2.1.3 Turmeric as an indicator
We have used blue and red litmus paper strips in Activity 2.1. Can
you also make paper strips with some other natural indicators?
Find out by performing the following activity.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
Activity 2.5: Let us prepare
 Take a spoonful of turmeric (haldi) in a petri dish or container
and add a little water to make a paste (Fig. 2.9a). You may
also grind a piece of fresh turmeric.
 Carefully dip a piece of ﬁlter paper in the turmeric paste
until it gets yellow colour.
 Take it out and allow it to dry.
 Cut this yellow paper into thin strips, which are used as
‘turmeric paper’ (Fig. 2.9b).
Caution — Perform this step under the supervision of an adult.

Turmeric is a member of the ginger family,
which is grown in India and other countries.
A common spice in daily households, it is being
researched for beneﬁts beyond the taste and

Are there any substances
whose odours change on
adding acidic or basic
substances?

There are some substances whose odours change in an acidic
or basic medium. These are called olfactory indicators.
Let us explore more!

 Keep them on a clean surface and put a few drops of
tamarind water on one strip and a few drops of baking soda
solution on the other. Allow the drops to spread on the strips.
 Check the odour again.
 Do you notice any change in the odour of the onion strips
before and after putting tamarind water and baking soda

Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray (P.C. Ray) is known as the
‘Father of Modern Indian Chemistry’. He earned a doctorate
in chemistry from the United Kingdom and returned to
India. He contributed towards advancing
scientiﬁc research in India. He also
established India’s ﬁrst pharmaceutical
company (a company in the ﬁeld of
medicines) in 1901. He was a person rooted
in Indian culture and knowledge traditions.
Through his writings on the history of
chemistry in India, he highlighted the
achievements and expertise of ancient
Indian scientists to the modern world. Ray, a social reformer,
also advocated the use of the mother tongue as a medium of
instruction in educational institutions.

2.2 What Happens When Acidic Substances
Mix with Basic Substances?

Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral
17
Let us investigate by performing the following experiment.
Activity 2.7: Let us experiment
 Take one drop of lemon juice in a test tube and
add around twenty drops of water to it. Observe
the colour.
 Add a drop of blue litmus solution to it.
 Do you observe any colour change (Fig. 2.10a)?
 Slowly add drops of lime water to this test tube with
the help of a dropper and swirl it well.

Fig. 2.10(a): The colour of the
solution on adding blue litmus
solution
 What do you observe? Is there any change in the
colour of the solution?
 A stage comes when the colour of the solution
changes from red to blue (Fig. 2.10b).
 Again, add one drop of lemon juice to the above
solution.
Can you predict why there is a change in colour?

Chapter 2.indd 17
Fig. 2.10(b): The colour of the
solution on adding lime water
4/3/2025 4:50:52 PM
Initially, when a drop of blue litmus solution is added to the
lemon juice solution, the colour of the solution turns red. When
lime water is added to this test tube, the colour of the solution
eventually changes from red to blue. This shows that the solution
in the test tube is no longer acidic. Lime water has neutralised
the eﬀect of the acid.
When the solution of an acid is mixed with the solution of a
base in suﬃcient quantity, we ﬁnd that the resulting solution is
neither acidic nor basic. Such reactions are called neutralisation
reactions. In a neutralisation reaction, salt and water are formed
with the evolution (i.e., release) of heat.
Acid + Base → Salt + Water + Heat
There are many examples in everyday life where you can
observe the use of neutralisation processes.
Let us ﬁnd out!

2.3 Neutralisation in Daily Life
18
Chapter 2.indd 18
Fig. 2.11: Stinging eﬀect
of an ant bite
Fig. 2.12: Neutralising the acidic
nature of soil
Situation 1: Keerthi was observing a butterﬂy in
the garden with her hand resting on a tree trunk.
Suddenly, a red ant bit her, leaving her skin red
with stinging pain (Fig. 2.11). Her brother helped
her by applying moist baking soda to the aﬀected
area, which relieved the pain. What do you think
might be the reason for this?
When an ant bites, it injects an acidic liquid
(formic acid) into the skin. The eﬀect of the acid
can be neutralised by rubbing moist baking soda,
which is a base.
What remedies do people use to treat ant bites
in your region?
Situation 2: On the Farmer’s Portal (an
online platform from the Department of
Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers
Welfare), a query from a farmer states, “My
plants are not growing well lately”. After
a detailed discussion, it was found that
the excessive use of chemical fertilisers
(substances added to soil to help plants
grow better) made the soil acidic. What
remedy might be provided to him?
When the soil is too acidic, the plants
do not grow well. It can be treated with
lime, which is a base. (Fig. 2.12).

4/3/2025 4:50:53 PM
If the soil is basic, organic matter like manure and composted
leaves are added to it. Organic matter releases acids that
neutralise the basic nature of the soil.
Sometimes, the soil may be neutral, but the plants growing in
it may still show poor health, which can be due to the deﬁciency
of nutrients in the soil.
Situation 3: Ashwin’s friend Gurbir stays near an industrial area.
He shared with him that the ﬁsh population in his neighbourhood
lake was declining day by day! What do you think might be the
causes for this? It may be due to factory waste being released
into the lake.
If the factory waste is acidic in nature, what could be done to
save the ﬁsh in the lake?
The factory waste can be neutralised by adding basic
substances before releasing into the lake.
Let us wrap up!
Now, can you explain why the words ‘Welcome to the Wonderful
World of Science’ appeared on Ashwin and Keerthi’s paper sheets
when the liquid was sprayed on them?
Do you think that one possibility could be using a turmeric
solution for the spraying liquid and a soap solution for writing
on the paper?

Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral
19
In a Nutshell
 Substances around us may be classiﬁed as acidic, basic, and
neutral in nature.
 Extracts of lichen, red rose, red hibiscus, purple cabbage,
turmeric, etc., can be used to indicate the nature of substances.
 Substances that show diﬀerent colours in acidic and basic
solutions are called acid-base indicators.
 Acids turn the colour of blue litmus to red. Bases turn the
colour of red litmus to blue.
 Extract of red rose gives red colour in acidic solutions and
green colour in basic solutions.
 The yellow colour of turmeric turns red in basic solutions
but remains unchanged in acidic and neutral solutions.
 An acid and a base neutralise each other, forming salt and
water, along with the evolution of heat.
 Many day-to-day problems like a red ant bite, acidic or basic
nature of soil, and industrial waste can be attempted to be
managed by the process of neutralisation.
