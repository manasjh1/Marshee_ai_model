Electricity:
Circuits and their
Components

Nihal and his classmates were excited for their school trip to the
Bhakra Nangal Dam. There they would visit the hydroelectric
power house where the force of falling water was used to generate
electricity. They also looked forward to the free 13 kilometretrain ride from Nangal in Punjab to Bhakra in Himachal Pradesh,
along the beautiful Sutlej river and through the Shivalik hills.
Prior to the trip, Nihal and his classmates were given a group
assignment to prepare a presentation on the uses of electricity.
They began by looking around their houses, then their school,
followed by their neighbourhood, their city, and ﬁnally they
searched the internet. To their astonishment, their list kept
growing. They decided to organise the uses under diﬀerent
headings.

Can you help Nihal by adding some more uses to his lists?
Also, suggest some other ways of grouping the uses of electricity.
We use electricity all the time, so let us learn something more
about electricity. You have learnt earlier that electricity is
generated in multiple ways — by windmills, by using wind
energy, by solar panels capturing the Sun’s energy, by falling
water and by using natural gas or coal (in the chapter ‘Nature’s
Treasures’ in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity). The electric
supply from these sources reaches our homes and factories via
wires. For example, at home we plug in various devices to the
electrical sockets in the wall. However, to learn about electricity,
we will focus on a portable source of electricity that most of us
may have used. Let us start with its use in a common device like
a torchlight.
Caution — The danger signs on electric poles and
other appliances warn people that electricity can
be dangerous if not carefully handled. Never ever
perform experiments with power supply at your
home or school. Even electricity from portable
generators can be dangerous. Use only batteries or
cells, like those in torchlights, wall clocks, radios, or
remotes, for experiments with electricity.

3.1 A Torchlight
You might have used a torchlight, also called a torch or a ﬂashlight.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

Activity 3.1: Let us explore
 Take a torchlight similar to the one shown in Fig. 3.1.
 Observe it carefully. Do you notice a lamp? And a switch?
 Slide its switch and observe. Does the torch lamp glow?
 Now slide the switch back to its original position and observe
the torch lamp.
You might have noticed that in the ﬁrst position of the switch,
Fig. 3.1: A torchlight
the torch lamp glows and in the other position the lamp does not
glow.
 Now, open the torchlight. What do you ﬁnd inside?
Inside the torchlight, you may ﬁnd two or more electric cells.
Why does the torch lamp
glow in one position of
its switch?

To understand how a torch works, let us ﬁrst ﬁnd out about its
components.

3.2.1 Electric cell
Activity 3.2: Let us observe
 Take an electric cell, turn it around and look at
it carefully (Fig. 3.2). Do you notice a positive
(+) sign and a negative (–) sign marked on the
electric cell? Do you also notice that it has a
small protruding metal cap on one side and a
ﬂat metal disc on the other side?

Negative

Fig. 3.2: An electric cell

All electric cells have two terminals; one is called positive (+ ve)
while the other is negative (– ve). The metal cap is the positive
terminal of the electric cell and the metal disc is the negative
terminal. The electric cell is a portable source of electrical energy.

3.2.2 Battery
Activity 3.3: Let us experiment

Electricity: Circuits and their Components

3.2 A Simple Electrical Circuit

In a torch, we generally
use more than one cell.
Are those placed in any
particular order?

 Take a torch which uses two cells. Open its cell compartment
and take out the cells.
 Put the cells back in a diﬀerent order. Also, try reversing
the direction of one cell. Then, slide the switch and check
whether the lamp glows in each case.
 Check the order in which the cells were placed in the torch
when the lamp glows.
The lamp glows when the cells are placed in the order as
shown in Fig. 3.3. Notice how the terminals of the two cells are
connected. The positive terminal of one cell is connected to the
negative terminal of the next cell. Such a combination of two or
more cells is called a battery.

Chapter 3.indd 25

4/3/2025 4:51:26 PM

For many devices, we may need more than one cell. So,
we connect two or more cells together as shown in Fig. 3.3.
Connecting more than one cell provides energy to the circuit for
a longer time and/or more energy.

FASCINATING FACTS

The term battery is also used for a single cell. We use the term battery
even for the single cell that powers our mobile phones.

For this activity, you will require a torchlight with an
incandescent lamp (or light bulb). Many old torchlights
still use such lamps. With your teacher’s help, conﬁrm
that your torchlight uses an incandescent lamp.
 Take the torch and examine its lamp. What do you
see? Do you notice a thin wire ﬁxed in the middle
of the glass bulb?
 Now, switch on the torch. Which part of the lamp
glows?
The thin wire inside the glass bulb of the lamp glows.
The glowing thin wire is called the ﬁlament of the lamp.
 Take out the lamp with the help of your teacher and
inspect it from all sides. How is the ﬁlament ﬁxed?
The ﬁlament is attached to two thicker wires that
support it, as shown in Fig. 3.4a. One thick wire connects
to the metal case at the lamp’s base, while the other
connects to the metal tip at the centre of the base (Fig.
3.4b). These form the two terminals of the lamp, and
are ﬁxed in a way that they do not touch each other.
In such incandescent lamps, the ﬁlament gets hot and
glows to produce light.
However, my torch has a
diﬀerent kind of lamp. In fact, it
cannot be taken out of the torch
as it is ﬁxed in it.

Many torches in use today have a Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamp,
instead of an incandescent lamp, as shown in Fig. 3.5.

Activity 3.5: Let us observe
 Take an LED of any colour (Fig. 3.6) and
observe. Do you see any ﬁlament inside it?
 Notice the length of two wires attached to
the LED. Do you ﬁnd one of those longer
than the other?

Unlike incandescent lamps, LEDs do not
have ﬁlaments (Fig. 3.6). They also have two
terminals, but one is positive (attached to a
longer wire) and the other is negative (the
Fig. 3.6: LEDs of different colours
shorter wire). A torch may use one or more
LEDs, sometimes of diﬀerent shapes, in its
lamp.
After having learnt about the electric cell, battery, and electric
lamps, we are now ready to make the torch lamp glow using an
electric cell or battery.

3.2.4 Making an electric lamp glow using an
electric cell or battery
Activity 3.6: Let us construct
 Take an electric cell, an incandescent lamp used in a torch, a
cell holder, a lamp holder, and four lengths of electric wire.
 Remove about 1 cm of the plastic covering from both ends of
each wire to expose the metal.
 Attach two wires to the two ends of the cell holder as shown
in Fig. 3.7a.

 Insert the cell in the holder such that its negative terminal
is towards the spring side of the holder (Fig. 3.7b). In case a
cell holder is not available, ﬁx the two wires to the cell using
electrical tape (Fig. 3.7c).

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

 Attach two wires to the screws of the lamp holder as shown
in Fig. 3.8a. Fix the lamp in the holder by turning it around in
the holder (Fig. 3.8b). In case a lamp holder is not available,
use electrical tape to attach two wires to the two ends of the
lamp (Fig. 3.8c).

Now, we are ready to connect the cell to the lamp to make it glow.
 We will conduct this activity in two parts — prediction and
observation. Some of the ways in which the lamp and the cell
can be connected are shown in Table 3.1.




Predict, for each arrangement, if the lamp will glow or
not and write your prediction in Table 3.1.
Now, connect the lamp and the cell, and observe if the
lamp glows or not. Note down your observation in Table
3.1. Also, for the lamps which glow, colour their glass
bulbs yellow.

The lamp glows in the arrangements at S.No. 1 and 6 and does
not glow in the remaining arrangements. Now, carefully look at
the arrangements in which the lamp glows. Compare these with
those in which the lamp does not glow. Can you ﬁnd the reason
for the diﬀerence?

3.2.5 An electrical circuit
The lamp glows when one terminal of the lamp is connected to
one terminal of the electric cell and the other terminal of the
lamp to the other terminal of the cell as shown in Fig. 3.9. This
setup forms an electrical circuit, which provides a
complete path for electric current to ﬂow through
the lamp. The lamp glows only when current passes
through the circuit.
The direction of electric current in an electrical
circuit is taken to be from the positive to the negative
terminal of the electric cell. When the terminals of
the lamp are connected with those of the electric cell
by wires, the current passes through the ﬁlament
of the incandescent lamp and makes it glow. With
an incandescent lamp, it does not matter which of
its terminals connects to the positive or negative
terminal of the cell. The lamp will glow as long as
Fig. 3.9: An electrical circuit the circuit is complete and current ﬂows through
the ﬁlament.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

FASCINATING FACTS

Sometimes, an incandescent lamp does not glow even when
connected to a cell. We say the lamp has ‘fused’ usually due to
a broken ﬁlament. A broken ﬁlament stops the ﬂow of current,
preventing the lamp from glowing.

Let us now try to make an LED glow.

Activity 3.7: Let us experiment
 Take two electric cells, an LED of any colour, a cell holder
that can ﬁt two cells (Fig. 3.8a), and two lengths of electric
wire.
 Remove about 1 cm of the plastic covering from both ends of
each wire to expose the metal.
 Connect the two wires to the cell holder as shown in
Fig. 3.10a.

30

Chapter 3.indd 30

4/3/2025 4:51:32 PM

 Insert two cells in the holder, taking care
that for each cell, its negative terminal
is towards the spring side of the holder
(Fig. 3.10b) and the battery is ready to use.
How will you decide which is the positive
terminal of this battery?
The terminal of the holder which is connected
to the positive terminal of one cell is positive
and the one connected to the negative terminal
of the other cell is the negative terminal.
 Now, connect the free end of the battery
positive terminal wire to the longer wire of
LED, and the free end of the second wire to
the shorter wire of LED (Fig. 3.10c). Does the
LED glow?

+

(a)

+

 Repeat the above step but interchange the
wires connected to the LED (Fig. 3.10d).
Does the LED glow again?
You would have observed that the LED glows
in the ﬁrst case (Fig. 3.10c) and does not glow in
the other (Fig. 3.10d). It is because the current
can pass through the LED in one direction only.
The current passes through the LED only when
the positive terminal (longer wire) of the LED is
connected to the positive terminal of the battery,
and negative terminal (shorter wire) of the LED
is connected to the negative terminal of the
battery. When current passes through the LED,
it glows. Always take care to connect an LED
correctly in a circuit to make it glow.

Fig. 3.10: Making an LED glow

Sometimes you may come across a device in which the cells are placed
side by side. Then, how are the terminals of the cells connected?
If you carefully look inside
the battery compartment, you
will usually see a thick wire
or metal strip connecting the
positive terminal of one cell
to the negative terminal of
the next. To help with proper
placement, ‘+’ and ‘–’ symbols
are typically printed inside.

Let us ﬁrst make a simple
switch on our own.

How does a switch turn
on or oﬀ the torchlight?

Activity 3.8: Let us construct

(b)

 Collect two drawing pins, a safety pin (or a
paper clip), two wires, and a small piece of
cardboard.
 Insert a drawing pin through the ring of the
safety pin and ﬁx it to the cardboard piece,
ensuring that the safety pin can rotate freely
(Fig. 3.11a).
 Fix the second drawing pin to the cardboard
piece so the free end of the safety pin can
touch it (Fig. 3.11b).
 Connect a wire to each drawing pin — our
switch is ready!
Let us now test our switch.

Activity 3.9: Let us test
 Connect the electric cell, lamp, and switch
as shown in Fig. 3.8a. Does the lamp glow?

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

 Rotate the free end of the safety pin till it
touches the other drawing pin as shown in
Fig. 3.8b. Does the lamp glow now?
(a)

(b)
Fig. 3.12: An electrical
circuit with a switch in
(a) ‘OFF’ position
(b) ‘ON’ position

When the safety pin touches both drawing
pins, it closes the gap and completes the path, and
allows the current to ﬂow. We call this the ON
position (Fig. 3.8b) where the circuit is closed
and current ﬂows from the cell’s positive to
negative terminal making the lamp glow. When
the safety pin does not touch the second drawing
pin, the gap in the circuit prevents current ﬂow,
and the lamp does not glow. In this OFF position
(Fig. 3.8a), we say that the circuit is open.
Note that a switch can be placed anywhere in
a circuit. A switch is a simple device that either
completes or breaks a circuit. The switches used
for lights and other devices at home work the
same way, though they are designed diﬀerently.

3.4 Electrical Conductors and Insulators
Why did we use metal wires for
making electric circuits? Can we
not use some other materials for
wires?
Also, why are electric wires
covered with plastic or
rubber?

electric current passes.

 Analyse your observations. Did the lamp glow for all
materials?
The lamp glows for some materials only. This means that
electric current can pass easily through some materials but not
through others. The materials through which electric current
can ﬂow easily are called good conductors, or conductors of
electricity. The materials through which current cannot pass
through are called insulators, or poor conductors of electricity.
 Based on the observations you have recorded in Table 3.3,
conclude which materials are conductors of electricity and
which are insulators. Note it in Table 3.3.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

EEPER
DIVE

From your conclusions in Table 3.3, you would have realised
that metals are conductors of electricity, and thus, are used for
making wires.
Silver, copper, and gold are the best electrical conductors.
However, for making electrical wires, mainly copper is used
due to its comparatively lower cost and abundant supply.
Diﬀerent types of electrical wires are used for diﬀerent uses.

From Table 3.3, you would have also realised that plastic,
rubber, and ceramics are electrical insulators. Have you now
understood why wires are covered with those materials?
Conductors and insulators are both important. Electrical
wires, switches, connectors of plugs, and sockets are made of
conductors. Insulators like rubber, plastics, and ceramics are
used to cover wires, plug tops, and switches to protect people
from electric shocks.

EEPER
DIVE

Caution — Our body is a conductor of electricity. Electric current
passing through our body may cause severe injury or even death.
Always handle electrical appliances with care. Never touch switches or
plugs with wet hands, or use electrical devices in wet areas, or handle
equipment with damaged insulation or broken plugs.
Have you ever wondered how the electricity from a cell or
battery is diﬀerent from the electricity coming from a wall
socket? Electricity from batteries usually powers small
devices and is of a type called Direct Current (DC). In contrast,
the electricity from power plants that come to the wall socket
is known as Alternating Current (AC) and can run larger
appliances.
