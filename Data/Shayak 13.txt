Nutrition in Plants

MODES OF NUTRITION
ll the living organisms plants and animals require food The organisms need to take food i to
obtain energy ii to obtain materials for growth and iii to obtain materials for the repair of
damaged parts of the body The process of taking food by an organism as well as the utilisation
of this food by the organism is called nutrition Plants can make their own food but animals including
human beings cannot make food themselves They obtain food from plants or other animals that eat
plants Thus human beings and animals depend on plants for their food directly or indirectly We will
now discuss the various modes of nutrition in organisms
The methods of obtaining food are called modes of nutrition On the basis of their modes of nutrition
all the organisms can be divided into two main groups
1 Autotrophs or Autotrophic and
2 Heterotrophs or Heterotrophic
We will now describe both these modes of nutrition of organisms in detail one by one
Autotrophs  Autotrophic Mode of Nutrition
Those organisms which can make food themselves from simple substances like carbon dioxide and
water by the process of photosynthesis are called autotrophs and their mode of nutrition is called
autotrophic All the green plants are autotrophs This is because green plants can make their own food
from simple substances like carbon dioxide and water present in their surroundings by the process of
photosynthesis In other words green plants have autotrophic mode of nutrition For example wheat
plants are autotrophs having autotrophic mode of nutrition Autotrophs contain a green pigment called
chlorophyll which helps them make food by absorbing energy from sunlight Most of the plants are green
and hence synthesise make their own food see Figure 1
This means that most of the plants have autotrophic mode of
nutrition The green plants produce food not only for
themselves they also make food for nongreen plants as
well as for animals including human beings
Our body and that of other animals cannot make food
from carbon dioxide and water present around us by the
process of photosynthesis like the plants do because our
body does not have the green pigment called chlorophyll
which the plants haveThe green pigment chlorophyll is
necessary to absorb energy from sunlight required for
making food by photosynthesis
Figure 1 Green plants can make food themselves
by photosynthesis so they are autotrophs Green
plants have autotrophic mode of nutrition
Heterotrophs  Heterotrophic Mode of Nutrition
Those organisms which cannot make food themselves by the process of photosynthesis and take
food from green plants or animals are called heterotrophs and their mode of nutrition is called
heterotrophic All the nongreen plants and animals
including human beings are heterotrophsThe nongreen
plants do not have chlorophyll for carrying out the process
of food making called photosynthesis So they depend on
other organisms plants or animals for obtaining their
food The nongreen plants called fungi such as
mushroom yeast and bread mould are heterotrophs They
have heterotrophic mode of nutrition Certain bacteria are
Plants
also heterotrophs All the animals including human
beings are categorised as heterotrophs because they Figure 2 Animals obtain their food from other
cannot make their own food they depend on plants or organisms like plants or other animals so they are
other animals for obtaining their food Thus all the animals heterotrophs Animals have heterotrophic mode of
like cat dog goat cow buffalo deer lion tiger and human nutrition This cow is an animal which is eating plants
as food
beings are heterotrophs having heterotrophic mode of
nutrition see Figure 2
PHOTOSYNTHESIS  FOOD MAKING PROCESS IN PLANTS
Green plants are autotrophic and synthesise or make their own food by the process of photosynthesis
The green plants make their food from simple inorganic substances like carbon dioxide and water in the
presence of sunlight The plants use the energy in sunlight to prepare food in the presence of a green
colouring matter called chlorophyll present in the leaves of a green plant We can now define
photosynthesis as follows
The process by which green plants make their own food like glucose from carbon dioxide and
water by using sunlight energy in the presence of chlorophyll is called photosynthesis The process of
photosynthesis can be represented by a word equation as follows
Carbon dioxide
From air

Water
From soil

Sunlight

Chlorophyll

Glucose
A carbohydrate
Food

Oxygen
Goes into air

Chlorophyll is present in the green leaves So the process of photosynthesis takes place in the leaves
of a plant Oxygen gas is produced during photosynthesis This oxygen goes into the air The oxygen gas
released in photosynthesis is utilised by all the living organisms for their survival The process of
photosynthesis can be shown with the help of a diagram given in Figure 3

Carbon dioxide  Water

Sunlight

Glucose

 Oxygen

Roots
Figure 3 Diagram to show the process of photosynthesis
The process of photosynthesis first produces a simple carbohydrate called glucose as food The
glucose carbohydrate then gets converted into a complex carbohydrate called starch This starch gets
stored as food in the various parts of plant including leaves In fact the presence of starch in the leaves
shows the occurrence of photosynthesis in a plant Some of the glucose is also converted into other types
of plant foods such as fats and oils proteins as well as vitamins The synthesis of food or making of food
occurs in the leaves of a plant or tree So leaves are the food factories of a plant The leaves of a plant
can synthesise food because they contain a green pigment chlorophyll which is necessary for making
food Other parts of a plant usually cannot synthesise food because they do not contain chlorophyll
Conditions Necessary for Photosynthesis
The presence of carbon dioxide water chlorophyll and sunlight is necessary for the process of
photosynthesis to take place Photosynthesis cannot occur in the absence of any one of these conditions
We will now describe how the leaves of a plant get carbon dioxide and water required for making food by
photosynthesis and what are the roles of chlorophyll and sunlight in photosynthesis
1 How the Plants Obtain Carbon Dioxide for Photosynthesis The plants take carbon dioxide gas
needed for photosynthesis from the air The plants take carbon dioxide gas from air through the tiny pores
called stomata present on the surface of leaves The singular of stomata is stoma Actually there are a
large number of tiny pores called stomata on the the surface of leaves of plants see Figure 4 Each pore
or stoma is surrounded by a pair of guard cells The opening and closing of stomatal pores in the leaves
is controlled by the guard cells Figure 4a shows open stomatal pores whereas Figure 4b shows the
stomatal pores in closed position The carbon dioxide gas present in air enters the leaves of a plant through
the stomatal pores present on their surface and utilised in photosynthesis The oxygen gas produced in the
leaves during photosynthesis goes out into air through the same stomatal poresThe stomatal pores of
leaves open only when carbon dioxide is to be taken in or oxygen is to be released otherwise they remain
closed
a Open stomata
b Closed stomata
Figure 4 Tiny pores called stomata are present on the surface of leaves
one pore is called stoma
2 How the Plants Obtain Water for Photosynthesis The plants take water needed for photosynthesis
from the soil Soil always contains some water in it Water present in the soil is absorbed by the roots of a
plant and then transported to the leaves through the vessels which run like interconnected pipes
throughout the roots stem branches and leaves The tiny pipelike vessels which transport water from the
roots of a plant to its leaves are called xylem
The plants also need minerals to make foods other than carbohydrates For example plants need
nitrogen mineral to make proteins The minerals are present in the soil and have to be transported to the
leaves The minerals dissolve in water present in the soil and get transported with it So we can now say
that  Water and minerals present in the soil are absorbed by the
roots of a plant and transported to its leaves through the interconnected pipelike xylem vessels present throughout the roots
stem branches and leaves of the plant
3 The Role of Chlorophyll in Photosynthesis
Chlorophyll is a green substance which is present in the
leaves of plants In fact it is the presence of chlorophyll
which makes the leaves look green Chlorophyll can
absorb the energy from sunlight The sunlight energy
absorbed by chlorophyll is used to combine carbon
dioxide and water in the green leaves to produce food
like glucose We can now write the role of chlorophyll in
photosynthesis as follows  Chlorophyll absorbs light
energy from the sun and supplies this energy to the Figure 5 The inner structure of a leaf to show
leaves to enable them to carry out photosynthesis for chlorophyll in it The various compartments shown in
making food Since the combination of carbon dioxide the above figure are cells of the leaf The tiny green
and water to make food like glucose occurs in the structures in the cells are chloroplasts which contain
presence of sunlight the process is called photosynthesis chlorophyll
Photo  light and synthesis  to combine Please note that chlorophyll is present in every leaf of a plant
in the form of hundreds of tiny structures called chloroplasts see Figure 5
4 The Role of Sunlight in Photosynthesis The sunlight supplies energy for the food making process
called photosynthesis The suns energy or solar energy is captured by plant leaves with the help of
chlorophyll and converted into chemical energy of food Thus solar energy is converted into chemical
energy during photosynthesis This chemical energy gets stored in the form of plant food So when plants
or animals utilise the food made by photosynthesis they actually use the solar energy stored in it in the
form of chemical energy Since all the food on this earth is made by utilising solar energy therefore sun
is the ultimate source of energy for all the living organisms
ACTIVITY TO TEST THE PRESENCE OF STARCH IN LEAVES
Leaves make starch as food by photosynthesis The presence of starch in leaves can be tested as follows
i Pluck a green leaf from a plant
ii Boil the leaf in alcohol to remove the green pigment chlorophyll from it
iii Wash the decolourised leaf with water to remove any chlorophyll sticking to it
iv Pour dilute iodine solution from a dropper over the decolourised leaf
v Appearance of blueblack colour in leaf shows the presence of starch in it
Leaves of Various Colours
Most of the plants have green coloured leaves Some of the plants however have leaves of other
colours such as red violet brown etc see Figure 6 The leaves having colours other than green also have
chlorophyll in them Actually the large amount of red violet brown or other pigments in such leaves
masks the green colour of chlorophyll So photosynthesis also takes place in leaves having colour other
than green
Figure 6 Leaves of various colours
Photosynthesis by Plant Parts Other Than Leaves
Normally photosynthesis takes place only in the leaves of plants
In some plants however photosynthesis also takes place in other
parts of plants such as green stems and green branches The
green stems and green branches can do photosynthesis because they
contain chlorophyll For example the desert plants such as cactus
have tiny spinelike leaves to reduce the loss of water by
transpiration These tiny spinelike leaves of a cactus plant cannot do
photosynthesis The stem and branches of a cactus plant are green
which contain chlorophyll see Figure 7 So the green stem and
green branches of a cactus plant carry out the process of
photosynthesis to make food for the plant Please note that only those
stems and branches which are green in colour can do photosynthesis
Now the stems and branches of all the plants and trees are not green Figure 7 The green stem and branches of
So the stems and branches of all the plants and trees cannot do a cactus plant contain chlorophyll and
hence carry out photosynthesis
photosynthesis
Photosynthesis by Algae
Many times we have seen patches of slimy green layer
floating on the surface of a pond or lake or even in the
stagnant parts of a river see Figure 8 It also develops in the
swimming pools which have not been cleaned for a long
time This green layer is formed by the growth of tiny green
plantlike organisms called algae Algae is pronounced as
algee The singular of algae is alga It is called shaiwal in
Hindi Algae are a large group of simple plantlike
organisms Algae contain chlorophyll and produce food by
photosynthesis just like plants Algae however differ from
plants because they do not have proper roots stems and
leaves The green colour of algae is due to the presence of
chlorophyll in them
Figure 8 The green layer floating on the surface of
water in this lake is that of algae
Synthesis of Plant Foods Other Than Simple
Carbohydrate Glucose
The simplest food synthesised by the plants by photosynthesis is a simple carbohydrate called
glucose The glucose carbohydrate is made up of three elements  carbon hydrogen and oxygen The
plants use the simple carbohydrate glucose to make many other foods such as starch oils or fats proteins
and vitamins This is discussed below
i Plants Make Starch as Food Some of the simple carbohydrate glucose made by the plants
through photosynthesis is converted naturally into a complex carbohydrate called starch The starch is a
food which is stored in various parts of a plant such as roots stem leaves and seeds For example the
seeds or grains of wheat and rice have a lot of starch in them Potato and carrot plants store a lot of starch
in their roots
ii Plants Make Oils or Fats as Food Certain plants convert the simple carbohydrate glucose made
during photosynthesis into oils and store them in their seeds Such seeds are called oilseeds and give us
oil or fats for cooking food For example the seeds of sunflower plant contain a lot of oil stored in them
We can extract oil from sunflower seeds and use it as a food The oils obtained from plant seeds are
commonly known as vegetable oils Please note that just like carbohydrates glucose and starch oils and
fats are also made up of the same three elements  carbon hydrogen and oxygen
iii Plants Make Proteins as Food In addition to carbon hydrogen and oxygen proteins also contain
nitrogen element Plants combine some of the glucose carbohydrate made during photosynthesis with
nitrate minerals obtained from soil to make amino acids which are then made into proteins In this way
plants make proteins as food
Proteins are nitrogenous substances which contain nitrogen element We will now discuss from
where do the plants obtain nitrogen for making proteins This happens as follows  Nitrogen element is
present in abundance in air in the form of nitrogen gas However the plants cannot absorb nitrogen gas for
their needs like making proteins Now the soil has certain bacteria which convert nitrogen gas of air into
nitrogen compounds like nitrates and release them into soil Nitrates are the water soluble nitrogen
compounds which are absorbed by the plants from the soil alongwith water In this way the plants fulfil
their requirement of nitrogen The plants also obtain nitrogen from the nitrogenous fertilisers which the
farmers add to the soil in the fields from time to time
iv Plants Make Vitamins as Food Vitamins are highly complex substances which are an important
part of our food Vitamins are made by plants Vitamins are contained in vegetables fruits and cereals
made by plants Animals usually cannot make vitamins
Importance of Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is important for the existence of life on this earth In the absence of photosynthesis life
would be impossible on this earth This is due to the following reasons
i Photosynthesis by plants provides food to animals including human beings So the survival of
animals including human beings depends on the food made by plants by photosynthesis In the absence
of photosynthesis there would be no plants on this earth and hence no animals will survive
ii The process of photosynthesis by plants puts oxygen gas into the air It is this oxygen gas which
the animals including human beings use for breathing and respiration In the absence of photosynthesis
there would be no oxygen in air and hence no animals could exist on this earth
OTHER MODES OF NUTRITION IN PLANTS
Most of the plants have green pigment called chlorophyll and can make their own food They are
called autotrophic Some plants however do not contain chlorophyll and hence cannot synthesise their
food They are called heterotrophic and depend for food on other organisms Depending on their mode of
obtaining food all the heterotrophic plants can be divided into two main groups
i Parasites and
ii Saprophytes
Thus just like animals some plants have also heterotrophic modes of nutrition We will now discuss
the two types of plants called parasites and saprophytes which have heterotrophic mode of nutrition
Parasites
A plant or animal which lives on or inside another organism called host and derives the food
from it is called a parasite Those nongreen plants which obtain their food from the living bodies of other
plants or animals are called plant parasites or just parasites The living organism from whose body food
is obtained is called host of the parasite The parasite plants climb on the host plants from which they get
all the food A parasite plant produces certain special type of roots called
sucking roots which penetrate into the host plant The parasite sucks the
food materials from the host through these special roots
An example of parasite plant is Cuscuta It is called Amarbel in Hindi
Cuscuta plant does not have chlorophyll so it is not green in colour We
can see Cuscuta plant as a yellow tubular structure twining around the
Cuscuta plant
stem and branches of a tree see Figure 9 The tree on which Cuscuta plant
A parasite
climbs is called its host Cuscuta is a nongreen plant having a yellow
colour Since Cuscuta plant does not have the green pigment called
Host plant
chlorophyll it cannot synthesise its own food Cuscuta plant takes
or Host tree
readymade food from the tree or plant on which it climbs Since Cuscuta
plant deprives the host tree of valuable nutrients it is called a parasite We
find that Cuscuta plant depends on other plants for obtaining food
therefore Cuscuta plant has heterotrophic mode of nutrition Please note
that another name of Cuscuta is Dodder In addition to Cuscuta some other
examples of plant parasites are  Mistletoe Wheat rust and Corn smut
In the above discussion at many places we have used the term plant Figure 9 This figure shows a
parasite instead of just parasite This is because many animals also live parasite plant Cuscuta climbing on
as parasites For example the animals such as lice bedbugs leeches and the stem of its host plant or host
tree
mosquitoes which suck our blood are also parasites
Saprophytes
Those nongreen plants which obtain their food or nutrition from dead and decaying organic
matter are called saprophytes Dead and decaying organic matter means dead and decaying plants and
animal remains The nongreen plants called fungi read as  funjaaee derive their food from dead and
decaying organic matter so fungi are saprophytes Some of the common fungi are mushrooms bread
mould and yeast so we can also say that the fungi such as mushrooms bread mould and yeast are
saprophytes In other words the fungi such as mushrooms
bread mould and yeast have saprophytic mode of nutrition
which is a heterotrophic mode of nutrition Certain bacteria
are also saprophytes They are called saprophytic bacteria
Many times we see small fluffy umbrellalike plants
growing on rotting wood during the rainy season see Figure
10 These are a kind of fungus called mushrooms Fungus is
the singular of fungi They take their nutrition from the
rotting wood of a dead tree so they are saprophytes The
saprophytic plants like fungi do not have chlorophyll and
hence they cannot make their own food by photosynthesis
The nongreen saprophytic plants such as fungi obtain
their food as follows  The saprophytic plants fungi secrete Figure 10 This picture shows a fungus
digestive juices on the dead and decaying organic matter mushrooms growing on the rotting wood of a
and convert it into a solution They absorb the nutrients dead tree
from this solution This mode of nutrition in which plants
take in nutrients from dead and decaying organic matter is called saprophytic nutrition The plants which
use saprophytic mode of nutrition are saprotrophs
We can grow fungus on bread ourselves as follows  Take a slice of bread and
moisten it with water Keep it in a moist and warm place for 2 or 3 days We will
find that some fluffy patches appear on the surface of the slice of bread see Figure
11 These patches are of fungus plants The patches of fungus may be white
green brown black or any other colour If we look at this slice of bread through
a magnifying glass the fungus plants growing on its surface will appear to be
cottonlike threads spread on the slice of bread We will now describe how the
fungus grows on the slice of bread The tiny spores of fungus plants are always
present in air but we cannot see them with naked eyes When these tiny spores
land on wet objects under warm conditions they germinate and grow into new Figure 11 Fungus growing on
fungus plants It was one such airborne spore which settled and grew on the a slice of bread The growth of
moist slice of bread kept aside by us at a warm place for a few days Please note fungus has spoiled the bread
that the spores are a kind of seeds of fungus plants
Fungi also grow on pickles leather objects clothes and other articles which are left uncleaned in hot
and humid weather for a considerable time The growth of fungi may spoil many things during the rainy
season It is due to the growth of fungus that our leather shoes kept in the house sometimes get spoiled
during the rainy season
Fungi can be useful as well as harmful For example fungi such as mushrooms and yeast are useful
Mushrooms are eaten as a vegetable whereas yeast is used for producing alcohol Some fungi are also used
for making medicines For example the Penicillium fungus is used in making an antibiotic called penicillin
Fungi also cause diseases in plants and human beings Sometimes the whole crops standing in the fields
are destroyed by fungus The skin disease called ringworm in humans is caused by fungus
In addition to parasitic and saprophytic modes of nutrition in some plants there are also some other
plants whose modes of nutrition are somewhat peculiar These are called insectivorous plants and
symbiotic plants Let us discuss these peculiar modes of nutrition in plants in detail one by one
Insectivorous Plants
There are some green plants which obtain their food partly from the soil and atmosphere and partly
from small insects Those green plants which obtain their food partly from insects are called
insectivorous plants Insectivorous plants are also known as
carnivorous plants The insectivorous plants have specialised
leaves to catch the insects The insectivorous plants grow only in
those soils which do not contain sufficient nitrogen mineral These
insectivorous plants trap insects by various methods kill them
and digest them to obtain nitrogen compounds like amino acids
for their growth Some common examples of the insectivorous
plants or carnivorous plants are  Pitcher plant Sundew
Venus flytrap and Bladderwort The insectivorous plant called
pitcher plant is shown in Figure 12 The pitcher plant uses a
pitcher like organ to trap insects and digest them This is
Pitcher
explained below
Modified
leaf
In the pitcher plant the lamina or blade of the leaf is
modified into a hollow tube called pitcher see Figure 12 The
leaf apex top part of leaf forms a lid which can open or close the
mouth of the pitcher Inside the pitcher there are hair which are
directed downwards When an insect falls in the pitcher the lid Figure 12 Pitcher plant an insectivorous
plant
closes automatically The trapped insect gets entangled in the hair
of the pitcher and hence cannot come out After some time the
insect dies in the pitcher The walls of the pitcher secrete digestive juices which digest the proteins present
in the body of insect to form simpler nitrogen compounds like amino acids These simpler nitrogen
compounds are absorbed by the walls of the pitcher and used by the whole pitcher plant
Please note that insectivorous plants are green and carry out photosynthesis to obtain a part of the food
required by them But they do not get the nitrogen nutrient from the soil in which they grow So
insectivorous plants feed on insects to obtain the nitrogen compounds needed for their growth We can
now say that the insectivorous plants are partial heterotrophs They get some food by photosynthesis
and some by eating insects
Symbiotic Plants
The living together of two different species of plants as
if they are parts of the same plant and help each other in
obtaining food is called symbiosis and such plants are
known as symbiotic plants This type of nutrition involving
symbiosis occurs in the plants called lichens see Figure 13
Alga
In lichens the green coloured plant called alga autotroph
Green
and nongreen plant fungus saprophyte live together The
Fungus
fungus holds the alga cells in its mat of weblike hyphae thin
Nongreen
filaments The fungus plant absorbs the water and mineral
salts from the surroundings and supplies them to alga The
Figure 13 Lichen symbiotic plant
alga plant being green prepares the food by photosynthesis
As seen through microscope
and shares it with fungus Thus both alga and fungus gain
mutually from one another by living together This is an example of symbiosis The plants which exhibit
symbiosis are called symbiotic plants The condition where two different organisms live together and help each
other to survive is called symbiotic relationship Symbiotic relationship is advantageous to both the organisms
Another example of symbiotic relationship is provided by Rhizobium bacteria and leguminous plants
Rhizobium bacteria cannot make their own food Rhizobium bacteria live in the root nodules of leguminous
plants such as gram peas beans pulses etc Rhizobium bacteria convert nitrogen gas of air into water
soluble nitrogen compounds called nitrates and give them to the leguminous plants for their growth In
return leguminous plants give food and shelter to Rhizobium bacteria Thus Rhizobium bacteria and
leguminous plants have a symbiotic relationship
Certain fungi live in the roots of trees These fungi take up water and minerals from the soil and
supply them to the roots of the tree The tree in return provides food to these fungi This symbiotic
relationship is important for the survival of fungi as well as the tree
HOW NUTRIENTS ARE REPLENISHED IN THE SOIL
The main nutrients required by the plants are nitrogen phosphorus and potassium These are called
mineral nutrients or just minerals The plant nutrients like nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are
present in the soil naturally When the plants are grown they absorb the nutrients from the soil due to
which the amount of plant nutrients in the soil goes on decreasing And when the crop plants are grown in
the same fields again and again then the soil becomes deficient in plant nutrients like nitrogen phosphorus
and potassium Due to this the plant nutrients or minerals need to be added from time to time to enrich
the soil and restore its fertility The plant nutrients or minerals are replenished or put back in the soil in
the following two ways
1 Nutrients are Replenished in the Soil by Adding Fertilisers and Manures
Fertilisers and manures contain plant nutrients or
minerals such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium
etc So when fertilisers and manures are added to the soil
in the fields then the soil gets enriched with nutrients
like nitrogen phosphorus and potassium etc The crop
plants can then grow well in this soil Thus plant
nutrients are added in the cultivated fields in the form of
fertilisers and manures so as to get good crops In fact
many times we see the farmers spreading fertilisers and
manures in the fields see Figure 14 The gardeners also
put fertiliser and manure in the lawns and potted plants
This is done to provide essential nutrients for the growth
of plants so that we get healthy plants The two most
Figure 14 Fertiliser being spread in the fields to
common fertilisers which are used to provide plant
replenish the plant nutrients in the soil
nutrients or minerals in the fields are NPK and Urea
NPK fertiliser provides Nitrogen N Phosphorus P and Potassium K to the soil in the fields whereas
urea provides only nitrogen
Out of all the plant nutrients or minerals the crop plants grown in the fields require nitrogen in
maximum amount to make the proteins The crop plants take this nitrogen from the soil in the fields So
after the harvest the soil in the fields becomes deficient in nitrogen This nitrogen deficient soil is incapable
of growing another good crop Now one way to make this soil fertile again is to add nitrogen containing
fertilisers Another way is to grow leguminous crops in this soil How the growing of leguminous crops enriches
the soil with nitrogen will become clear from the following discussion
2 Nitrogen Can be Replenished in the Soil by Growing Leguminous Crops
Though a lot of nitrogen gas is present in the air but the plants cannot use nitrogen in gaseous form
The plants need nitrogen in the form of water soluble compounds such as nitrates The plants such as
gram chana peas pulses moong etc and beans are called leguminous plants or legumes The
leguminous plants have root nodules in them which contain Rhizobium bacteria see Figure 15 Rhizobium
bacteria can convert nitrogen gas of air into nitrogen compounds like nitrates So when a leguminous
crop is grown in a field the Rhizobium bacteria present in the root
nodules of leguminous plants convert nitrogen gas of air into
nitrogen compounds like nitrates Some of these nitrogen
compounds are used by the leguminous plants for their own
growth The remaining nitrogen compounds made by Rhizobium
bacteria mix with the soil in the field and enrich it Thus the soil
in the fields gets enriched with nitrogen compounds in the natural
way The growing of leguminuous crops in the fields is of great
importance to the farmers This is because the farmers do not
need to put nitrogen fertiliser in the fields in which leguminous
crops have been grown earlier This saves a lot of money
Figure 15 The nodules on the roots of this
pea plant which is a leguminous plant contain
Rhizobium bacteria which convert nitrogen gas
In biology a cell is the smallest unit of life All the living of air into nitrogen compounds such as
things plants and animals are made from cells Just as a house is nitrates
made of small units called bricks in the same way the bodies of
living organisms are made of tiny units called cells Thus cells are the building blocks of plants and
animals Cells are very very small in size which cannot be seen with naked eyes Cells can be seen only
under a microscope We can however see the plants and animals around us because they are made up of
millions and millions of tiny cells joined together
Some organisms are made of only one cell but others are made of many many cells joined together
For example the simplest animal called Amoeba is made up of only one cell but a complex organism like a
rose plant or a man is made up of millions of cells All living cells come only from other living cells The
cells are mainly of two types  Animal cells and Plant cells Though many things are common between
animal cells and plant cells but they differ in some ways
A cell consists of a jellylike material enclosed in a thin membrane see Figure 16 The jelly like
material which fills the cell is called cytoplasm The thin outer covering of the cell is called cell membrane
There is a large spherical structure floating in the centre of a cell which is called the nucleus The nucleus is
surrounded by jellylike material called cytoplasm A number of small bodies called mitochondria are also
present in the cell There are tiny air spaces in the cytoplasm of an animal cell which are called vacuoles The
general diagram of an animal cell is shown in Figure 16

We will now give the functions of all the parts of a cell The cell membrane protects the cell and also
controls the passage of materials which go into the cell or go out from the cell The function of nucleus
is to control all the activities of the cell like cell growth etc The function of mitochondria is to carry out
respiration for releasing energy from food The function of small vacuoles is to hold air water or particles
of food And the function of cytoplasm is to carry out all the activities of life processes or metabolism
All the parts of animal cells such as cell membrane cytoplasm nucleus and mitochondria are also
present in plant cells In addition to these the plant cells have three more parts in them These are cell wall
chloroplasts and large vacuoles These parts make the plant cells different from animal cells The general
diagram of a plant cell is given in Figure 17 All the plant cells have a thick cell wall around the cell
membrane The cell wall protects the cell gives it a fixed shape and makes it rigid strong The
chloroplasts contain chlorophyll and make food in green plants by the process of photosynthesis The large
vacuoles in plant cells are filled with cell sap which is a solution of sugars and other substances
The animals are made up of animal cells joined together whereas plants are made up of plant cells
combined together Since the animals and plants are made up of different types of cells therefore animals
and plants look different and behave in different ways We are now in a position to answer the following

CHAPTER
Nutrition in Animals
we have studied in the previous chapter that plants can make their own food by the process of
photosynthesis Animals however cannot make their own food by photosynthesis Since
animals cannot make their own food they need readymade food This readymade food comes
from plants or from other animals Thus animals obtain their food from plants or from other animals
which eat plants Some animals however eat both plant food as well as animal food We human beings
are also animals We obtain foods like wheat rice pulses dal fruits and vegetables from plants And the
foods like milk curd cheese and eggs are obtained from animals Some people also eat meat chicken and
fish as food These foods are also obtained from animals which eat plants as food
All animals including human beings require food for obtaining energy growth and repair of
damaged body parts The process of taking in food by an animal and its utilisation in the body is called
animal nutrition Nutrition in animals takes place in five steps  Ingestion Digestion Absorption
Assimilation and Egestion
1 The process of taking food into the body is called ingestion
2 The process in which the food containing large insoluble substances is broken down into small
water soluble substances which can be absorbed by the body is called digestion
3 The process in which the digested food passes through the intestinal wall into blood stream is called
absorption
4 The process in which the absorbed food is taken in by body cells and used for energy growth and
repair is called assimilation
5 The process in which the undigested food is removed from the body is called egestion
Animals Take in Food by Different Methods
The first step in the process of nutrition in animals is ingestion which means taking food into the
body or eating of food Different animals use different modes or methods of taking food into their body
In fact every animal has some special structures or organs for
taking food inside its body The methods used by some of the
animals to take in food or eat food are described below
Frog is an animal which eats flying insects as food The frog uses
its long and cleft tongue forked tongue to catch its prey like insects
A wall lizard and a chameleon girgit also catch their prey insects
etc with the help of their fairly long tongue The butterfly belongs to Feeding
tube
the category of insects The food of butterfly is nectar Nectar is a inserted in
flower
sugary liquid present inside the flowers The butterfly uses its long
feeding tube to suck nectar from flowers just as we sip Pepsi or
Flower
CocaCola see Figure 1 Bees and hummingbirds also suck the
nectar from flowers in plants Both male and female mosquitoes feed
by sucking nectar from flowers The female mosquitoes also suck
blood from other animals including human beings Infants small
babies of humans and many other animals such as cows dogs etc
Figure 1 Butterfly sucks nectar of
feed on mothers milk by sucking Lice are wingless insects which live
flowers with its feeding tube
on hair Lice feed by sucking blood from the skin of scalp Houseflies
feed on filth and refuse They take in only liquid food by sucking Houseflies spit out saliva on solid food
to convert it into a liquid and then suck this liquid Ants feed on plant material and other animals by biting
and chewing Snails feed on algae by scraping it from rocks Snakes are flesh eaters They eat animals like
rats etc Snakes including pythons swallow the animal whole which they prey upon Eagle is a large bird
which feeds on the flesh of its prey by tearing its flesh with powerful hooked beak Amoeba is a tiny aquatic
animal which ingests its food with the help of its pseudopodia or false feet
Hydra is an animal which uses its tentacles with sting cells to kill the prey and put it into the mouth
body cavity A spider weaves a web jaal to catch its prey A crow uses its long beak to put the food into
its mouth And we human beings use our hands to put food into our mouth Starfish is a sea animal
which has an amazing way of taking in food or ingestion Starfish feeds on sea animals such as shellfish
and oysters etc which are covered by hard shells of calcium carbonate After opening the shell of its prey
the starfish pops out its own stomach through its own mouth This stomach surrounds the soft body of the
prey which is inside the shell The starfish then brings back its stomach containing the prey or food into
the body This food is digested slowly by the starfish From the above discussion it is clear that there are
many different methods of eating food or ingesting food in the animal world
Digestion
Our food consists mainly of substances such as carbohydrates like starch fats and proteins with
small amounts of minerals and vitamins Now starch carbohydrate fats and proteins are all large
insoluble substances which cannot pass through the walls of our intestine and get absorbed as such So
before the food can be used by us for various functions like getting energy or for growth it must be broken
down into small water soluble substances which can be absorbed by our body The process in which the
food containing large insoluble substances is broken down into small water soluble substances which
can be absorbed by our body is called digestion In most simple terms digestion means dissolving of solid
food Digestion makes the food soluble so that it can be absorbed and utilised by the body
We use both physical and chemical methods for digesting breaking up the large substances
present in food Physical methods include chewing and grinding the food in mouth and chemical methods
include the addition of digestive juices to food by the body itself During the process of digestion the
complex starch carbohydrate present in our food is broken down into a simple sugar called glucose Fats are
broken into simpler substances called fatty acids and glycerol And proteins are broken down into simple
substances called amino acids Now glucose fatty acids glycerol and amino acids are all water soluble
simple substances which can pass through the wall of our small intestine into the blood and hence get
absorbed in the body The process of digestion takes place inside our body Before we describe the human
digestive system in detail we should know the meaning of alimentary canal This is described below
Alimentary Canal
A long tube running from mouth to anus of a human being or other animals in which digestion
and absorption of food takes place is called alimentary canal Alimentary canal is also known as gut or
digestive tract It is about 8 to 9 metres long in humans The alimentary canal is a continuous canal which
has many parts such as mouth buccal cavity oesophagus food pipe stomach small intestine large
intestine rectum and anus Three glands are also associated with alimentary canal These are salivary
glands liver and pancreas The food enters the alimentary canal at the mouth or buccal cavity As the
food travels through the various parts of alimentary canal it gradually gets digested During the passage
of food through alimentary canal the various glands salivary glands liver pancreas and inner walls of
stomach and small intestine secrete digestive juices These digestive juices convert the complex substances
of food into simpler substances which can be absorbed by the body The undigested part of food is
defecated thrown out through the last part of alimentary canal called anus
An important question now arises  How does food move forward in the alimentary canal  The food
moves forward in the alimentary canal by the process of peristalsis Peristalsis is the wavelike
movement caused by the alternate contraction and relaxation of the muscles of alimentary canal which
pushes the food forward in the alimentary canal We will also be using a term called buccal cavity The
mouth cavity by which food is taken into the alimentary canal and chewed is called buccal cavity We will
now describe what happens to the food when it passes through the different parts of the alimentary canal
or digestive tract
When we eat food it gets broken down into smaller and soluble substances during digestion The
digested food is absorbed and utilised by our body The undigested and unabsorbed portion of food is
removed from the body in the form of waste material called faeces We will now discuss the human
digestive system in detail
The human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and its associated glands The various
organs of the human digestive system in sequence are  Mouth Buccal cavity Oesophagus or Food
pipe Stomach Small intestine Large intestine Rectum and Anus The glands which are associated with
human digestive system and form a part of human digestive system are  Salivary glands Liver and
Pancreas Salivary glands are located in our mouth or buccal cavity Liver is a reddishbrown gland
situated in the upper part of abdomen on the right side Liver is the largest gland in the body Pancreas is
a large cream coloured gland located just below the stomach The ducts or pipes of various glands open
into the alimentary canal and pour the secretions of their digestive juices into the alimentary canal The
human digestive system is shown in Figure 2 We will now describe how food gets digested when it passes
through the various parts of alimentary canal
1 In the Mouth or Buccal Cavity
Food is taken into the body or ingested through the mouth The digestion of food starts as soon as
we put the food in our mouth The mouth or buccal cavity contains teeth tongue and salivary glands The
teeth cut the food into small pieces chew and grind it The salivary glands secrete a watery liquid called
saliva The tongue helps in mixing saliva with food Saliva is a digestive juice which helps to digest the
starch present in the food partially The slightly digested food is swallowed by the tongue and goes down
into oesophagus or food pipe see Figure 2

2 In the Oesophagus or Food Pipe
The oesophagus is a tube or pipe which
connects the mouth or buccal cavity to stomach
Oesophagus is commonly known as food pipe It
runs along the neck and chest Oesophagus
carries the slightly digested food from the mouth
to the stomach see Figure 2 The food coming from
mouth moves down through oesophagus by peristalsis
This happens as follows  When the food enters
oesophagus at the top end the muscles in the
walls of oesophagus start alternate contractions
and relaxations producing a wavelike movement
which pushes the food downwards towards the
stomach During vomiting however the food
moves in the opposite direction from stomach to
mouth by the process of antiperistalsis in the food
pipe
Stomach
Pancreas
3 In the Stomach
Small
intestine
The stomach is a thick walled bag present on
the left side of the abdomen see Figure 2 It is the
Large
intestine
widest part of the alimentary canal Oesophagus
or food pipe brings the slightly digested food
Rectum
Anus
from the mouth into stomach The food is further
digested in the stomach The food is churned in
Figure 2 Human digestive system
the stomach for about three hours During this
time the food breaks down into still smaller
pieces and makes a semisolid paste The inner lining of stomach secretes mucus hydrochloric acid and
digestive juices Mucus protects the lining of stomach from its own secretions of hydrochloric acid
Hydrochloric acid kills any bacteria which may enter the stomach with food Hydrochloric acid also makes
the medium in the stomach acidic which is necessary for the proper action of digestive juices on proteins
in the stomach The digestive juices secreted by the stomach lining break down the proteins present in our
food into simpler substances This happens in the acidic medium The partially digested food then goes
from the stomach into the small intestine
4 In the Small Intestine
The small intestine is a very long tube It is about 75 metres long Though small intestine is very long
it is called small intestine because it is a quite narrow tube The small intestine is arranged in the form of a
coil in our belly see Figure 2 The small intestine in human beings is the site of complete digestion of
food The small intestine is also the main region for the absorption of digested food This happens as
follows
a Complete Digestion of Food in Small Intestine The partially digested food from stomach comes
into small intestine The small intestine receives secretions of digestive juices from the liver pancreas and
its own walls All these digestive juices carry out the complete digestion of food as follows  Liver secretes
a liquid called bile which is stored temporarily in the sac called gall bladder The bile plays an important
part in the digestion of fats Actually bile converts fats into tiny droplets so that their further breakdown
becomes easy Pancreas secretes pancreatic juice Pancreatic juice breaks down fats completely into fatty
acids and glycerol Pancreatic juice also breaks down starch carbohydrate and proteins into simpler forms
The walls of small intestine secrete a digestive juice called intestinal juice Intestinal juice breaks down
the starch carbohydrate completely into the simplest sugar called glucose and the proteins into amino
acids In this way our food breaks down completely into very small water soluble substances like glucose
fatty acids glycerol and amino acids This is called digested food
b Absorption of Digested Food in Small Intestine The digested food can now pass into the blood
vessels in the walls of the small intestine This process is called absorption The small intestine is especially
adapted for absorbing the digested food This happens as follows  The inner surface of the small intestine
has millions of tiny fingerlike outgrowths called villi read as veelaee  singular of villi is villus The
presence of villi gives the inner walls of the small intestine a very large surface area which helps in the
rapid absorption of food Thus the role of villi in the small intestine is to increase the surface area for
the rapid absorption of digested food Each villus has a network of thin and small blood vessels called
blood capillaries close to its surface The surface of villi absorbs the digested food materials into blood
flowing through them Blood carries the absorbed food materials to the cells in all the parts of the body In
the cells food is used for energy growth and repair This is called assimilation Glucose breaks down in
the cells with the help of oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water and releases energy Fatty acids and
glycerol build components of cells and form fats to be stored in the body as food reserves Amino acids are
used to make proteins required for the growth and repair of the body
A part of the food which we eat cannot be digested by our body This undigested food cannot be
absorbed in the small intestine The food that remains undigested and unabsorbed passes from the small intestine
into large intestine
5 In the Large Intestine
The large intestine is about 15 metres long It is called large intestine because it is a quite wide tube
The undigested and unabsorbed food from the small intestine enters into large intestine The large
intestine absorbs most of the water from the undigested food material Due to the removal of water the
undigested food becomes semisolid This undigested food or waste material is stored in the last part of
the large intestine called rectum for some time When we go to toilet the undigested semisolid waste is
passed out from our body through anus in the form of faeces This is called egestion
ACTIVITY TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF SALIVA ON STARCH PRESENT IN FOOD
Our mouth contains salivary glands which secrete saliva During digestion saliva breaks down complex
carbohydrate starch present in food into a sugar We can observe the effect of saliva on starch containing
food by performing a simple activity as described below Since our common food rice contains starch so we
will use boiled rice as a source of starch in this activity
Take one teaspoonful of crushed boiled rice in a beaker and add about 20 mL water to it Stir with a glass
rod In this way we will get a mixture of crushed boiled rice with water which contains starch carbohydrate
Divide this mixture into two parts
i Take one part of crushed boiled rice and water mixture in a testtube and add 2 or 3 drops of dilute
iodine solution to it A blueblack colour is produced see Figure 3a This shows that boiled rice contains
starch
a
b
Figure 3 Activity to show the effect of saliva on starch in food here boiled rice
ii Take the second part of crushed boiled rice and water mixture in another testtube and add saliva from
mouth into it Keep this testtube in warm water for about 15 to 20 minutes Then add 2 or 3 drops of dilute
iodine solution No blueblack colour is produced in this case see Figure 3b This shows that there is no
starch in the boiled rice which has been treated with saliva
The above observation can be explained on the basis of action of saliva on starch as follows  When the
mixture of boiled rice and water is treated with saliva then saliva breaks down the starch present in boiled rice
to form a sugar Since no starch is left in the testtube after treatment of boiled rice with saliva therefore no
blueblack colour is produced on adding dilute iodine solution Thus saliva breaks down starch into sugar
The sugar which is formed by the breakdown of starch with saliva is called maltose
Why Do We Get Hiccups
The windpipe called trachea carries air from nostrils to our lungs And food pipe called oesophagus
carries food from mouth to stomach The windpipe runs adjacent to the food pipe in the body Inside the
throat however air and food share a common passage Then how the food which we eat is prevented from
entering our windpipe  This happens as follows  Normally when we swallow food then a flat piece of
cartilage called epiglottis drops over the mouth of windpipe forming a bridge over which food passes and
goes into food pipe without falling into windpipe Sometimes however when we eat too fast in a hurry
or talk too much or laugh while eating then a little of windpipe remains open due to which food particles
may enter the windpipe When food particles enter the windpipe we may get hiccups or a choking
sensation Hiccups produce a characteristic gulping sound repeatedly Hiccup is called hichki in Hindi
The blockage in windpipe caused by food particles is usually cleared by coughing
Before food can be used by the body it must be broken down into small pieces The first part of this
breakdown of food is done by the teeth We chew the food
with the teeth and break it down mechanically into small
pieces This is discussed below
There are four types of teeth in our mouth These are
i Incisors
ii Canines
iii Premolars and

teeth
The four types of teeth are shown in Figure 4 The
upper part of a tooth which we can see in the mouth
is called crown the middle part of a tooth which is
inside the gums is called neck whereas the lower part
of a tooth which is embedded in the jaw bone is
called root Every tooth is held in a separate socket in
the jaw The positions of four types of teeth in the
mouth are shown in Figure 5 Different types of teeth
Molars
differ in appearance and perform different functions
This is discussed below
Molars
i Incisors are the chisel shaped teeth at the front
Premolars
Premolars
of the mouth see Figure 5 The incisors are for
biting and cutting the food There are four
Canine
incisors in the centre of each jaw
Canine
Incisors
ii Canines are the large pointed teeth just behind
Figure 5 Diagram to show the positions of different
the incisors see Figure 5 The canines are for
types of teeth incisors canines premolars and molars
piercing and tearing the food There are two
in the mouth
canines in each jaw one behind the left incisor and the other behind right incisor
iii Premolars are the large teeth just behind the canines on each side see Figure 5 Premolars have
large flat surfaces The premolars are for chewing and grinding the food There are four premolars
in a jaw two on each side
iv Molars are very large teeth which are present just behind the premolars towards the back of our
mouth see Figure 5 The molars have a larger surface area than premolars The function of molars
is the same as that of premolars That is molars are for chewing and grinding the food There are
six molars in each jaw three on each side Please note that molars are present only in the permanent
set of teeth They are not present in the temporary set of teeth called milk teeth
Most of the adult men and women have a total of 32 teeth Of these 16 are in the upper jaw and 16 are
in the lower jaw The 16 teeth of each jaw consist of 4 incisors 2 canines 4 premolars and 6 molars The
teeth of upper jaw match with the teeth of lower jaw
Milk Teeth and Permanent Teeth
In human beings the teeth grow twice First time the teeth grow when one is a small baby or infant
This set of teeth is called milk teeth Thus the first set of teeth which grow during infancy babyhood
are called milk teeth Milk teeth are a temporary set of teeth The milk teeth loosen and begin to fall off at
the age between 6 and 8 years When milk teeth fall off in a child then another set of teeth grow in their
place So second time the teeth grow when one is a child The second set of teeth is called permanent
teeth The permanent teeth grow in place of milk teeth The permanent set of teeth remains till the old age
But when old people lose their permanent teeth then new teeth do not grow in their place
Tooth Decay
The white hard outer covering of tooth is called enamel see
Enamel
Figure 6 The part of tooth below the enamel is called dentine
Dentine
Dentine is similar to bone Inside the dentine is pulp cavity which
contains nerves and blood vessels If the teeth are not cleaned
Pulp cavity
contains nerves
regularly then tooth decay can take place Tooth decay is a process
and blood vessels
in which the tooth becomes rotten due to the formation of cavities
holes inside it leading to toothache Tooth decay occurs as follows
If we do not clean our teeth and mouth after eating food then
many harmful bacteria begin to grow and live on the teeth These
bacteria act on the sugar present in the leftover food particles
sticking to the teeth to form acid The acid thus formed eats up the
Figure 6 Parts of a tooth
enamel and dentine of the tooth gradually and ultimately makes a
cavity or hole in the tooth see Figure 7a When this cavity or hole reaches the pulp cavity of the tooth
which contains nerves our tooth becomes painful and we get toothache see Figure 7b If the cavities

Figure 7 Tooth decay
caused by tooth decay are not treated in time by fillings etc by a dentist then it causes severe toothache
In extreme cases tooth decay can lead to the loss of whole tooth because it may require extraction
Excessive use of sugar containing foods such as sweets chocolates toffees ice cream and cold drinks
etc are the major cause of tooth decay Tooth decay can be prevented in the following ways
1 We should rinse the mouth thoroughly with clean water after every meal
2 We should clean our teeth with a brush and toothpaste at least twice a day
3 A dental floss should be used to take out food particles trapped between the teeth Dental floss is a
soft thread used to clean between the teeth
4 We should eat less of sugary foods such as sweets chocolates toffees and ice cream etc Too many
cold drinks should also be avoided this is because sugar  bacteria  acid which eats up tooth
TONGUE
The tongue is a fleshy muscular organ in the mouth which is attached at the back to the floor of the
buccal cavity mouth cavity It is free at the front and can be moved in all directions The various functions
of the tongue are as follows
1 The tongue helps in mixing saliva with food during chewing which is essential for the digestion of
food
2 The tongue helps in swallowing the food into the food pipe
3 The tongue helps in getting the taste of food
4 The tongue is essential for talking or speaking
We have just said that the tongue helps in getting the taste of food Let us discuss it in somewhat
detail There are four types of tastes  sweet salty sour and bitter For example sugar solution has a sweet
taste common salt solution has a salty taste lemon juice has a sour taste whereas an extract of neem leaves
or bitter gourd karela has a bitter taste The cold strong and unsweetened coffee and medicines like
aspirin also have a bitter taste
The tongue has taste buds which detect different tastes of food In fact our tongue has four kinds of
taste buds which detect sweet salty sour and bitter tastes The taste buds for each of these tastes are
located in different parts of the tongue Thus all the parts of the tongue do not sense all the four tastes
Different parts of the tongue are sensitive to different tastes Figure 8 shows
the positions of different taste buds on the tongue
i Most taste buds at the front of the tongue detect sweet and salty
tastes The maximum effect of sweet taste is felt at the tip of the
tongue whereas the maximum effect of salty taste is felt just behind
the tip of the tongue see Figure 8
ii Most of the taste buds on the sides of the tongue detect sour taste see
Figure 8
iii Most of the taste buds at the back of the tongue detect bitter taste see

DIARRHOEA
The condition in which a person passes out watery stools frequently is called diarrhoea Diarrhoea
is called dast in Hindi Diarrhoea may be caused by an infection due to diseasecausing microorganisms food poisoning or indigestion Diarrhoea is a kind of disease Diarrhoea is very common in
India particularly among children In fact diarrhoea is one of the major causes of death of small children
in our country Diarrhoea leads to the loss of water and salts from the body of a person through frequent
watery stools The loss of water from the body of a person through watery stools is called dehydration
SOME ANIMALS EAT GRASS AS FOOD
The sudden loss of too much water or dehydration makes a person dangerously ill in a very short time
Excessive dehydration of body caused by diarrhoea can even lead to death So diarrhoea should never be
neglected
In order to prevent dehydration the person suffering from diarrohea should be given a solution of
sugar and salt in clean water many times a day The solution of sugar and salt in water is called Oral
Rehydration Solution ORS because it is given to the person orally through mouth We can make an
oral rehydration solution ourselves by dissolving a teaspoonful of sugar and a pinch of salt in a glass of
clean water The water used for this purpose should be first boiled and then cooled so as to make it germfree Oral rehydration solution makes up the loss of water and salt in the body The sugar gives energy
which helps in speedy recovery Thus the dehydration of body can be prevented during diarrhoea by
giving oral rehydration solution regularly to the patient Meanwhile a doctor should be called in for
giving medicines to cure the cause of diarrhoea
The herbivorous animals such as cattle cows buffaloes goat sheep deer antelope and giraffe etc
eat mainly grass and other plant leaves as food Grass is rich in a carbohydrate called cellulose which acts
as a source of energy Cellulose carbohydrate is a quite tough material so more times it is chewed by the
animal the better The cellulose carbohydrate present in grass can be digested by the action of certain
bacteria which are present only in the stomach of animals called ruminants like cattle cows buffaloes
goat sheep deer antelope giraffe etc Thus in herbivorous animals grass eating animals the stomach
is adapted to digest the food like grass and leaves We will now describe the digestion in grasseating
animals like cow in detail
DIGESTION IN GRASSEATING ANIMALS
The animals such as cow which eat grass have a special stomach to digest the tough cellulose
carbohydrate present in grass The stomach of a cow is large and consists of four compartments or four
chambers The first compartment of a cows stomach is
Rumen
the biggest and it is called rumen see Figure 9 When
cow eats grass as food while grazing it does not chew it
completely because it has no time for it The cow
swallows the grass quickly with little chewing and stores
it in the rumen which is the first compartment of
stomach The rumen contains cellulose digesting
Stomach
bacteria The bacteria present in the rumen of a cow start
to digest cellulose carbohydrate present in grass food
Thus the grass is partially digested in the rumen The
partially digested food or partially digested grass in
the rumen of a cow is called cud
After some time when the cow is resting the cud
Figure 9 Digestive system of a ruminant
from rumen is brought back to the mouth of cow in small
here a cow
amounts at a time The cow now chews the cud
thoroughly This is why many times we see a cow or buffalo moving its jaws from side to side and
chewing continuously even when it is not eating grass The process by which the cud partially digested
food is brought back from the stomach to the mouth of the animal and chewed again is called
rumination or chewing the cud All the animals which chew the cud are called ruminants
When the cud is thoroughly chewed in the mouth of the cow it is swallowed again But this chewed
cud does not go back to rumen The thoroughly chewed cud now goes into the other compartments of the
cows stomach and then into the small intestine for complete digestion and absorption
The ruminants like cow cannot chew their food grass completely at the time when they eat it
because they have very short time available for grazing grass So they want to store as much grass as
possible in their stomach in the short time available to them The animals called ruminants can survive on
grass as food because they have certain bacteria in the rumen part of their stomach which can digest the
cellulose carbohydrate present in grass and other plant leaves The cellulose digesting bacteria are not
present in the body of human beings due to which human beings cannot digest cellulose carbohydrate
present in plant foods We human beings cannot survive by eating only grass or raw leafy vegetables
because these foods contain mainly cellulose carbohydrate and our body does not have bacteria which can
digest cellulose carbohydrate
So far we have discussed the digestion in human beings and other animals which possess digestive
system made up of a number of organs working together There are however many small animals which
do not have a mouth and a digestive system One example of an organism having no fixed mouth and no
digestive system is a tiny animal called Amoeba We will now discuss how such organisms take in food
ingest food and digest it
Amoeba is a microscopic organism very small organism which consists of a single cell see Figure 10
Actually Amoeba is the simplest animal Amoeba lives in pond water Amoeba is so small that it can hardly
be seen with naked eyes The structure of Amoeba given in
Cell
Figure 10 is as seen through a microscope Amoeba has a
membrane
cell membrane a round dense nucleus and many small
Cytoplasm
bubblelike vacuoles in its cytoplasm The vacuoles in Contractile
Amoeba are of two types  food vacuoles and contractile
vacuole
vacuoles A food vacuole consists of a bubble of water
Nucleus
containing the food particle captured by Amoeba The
contractile vacuole is a bubble of liquid It controls the
Food

amount of water present in the body of Amoeba The most
important feature of Amoeba is that it has no fixed
shape The shape of Amoeba keeps on changing
Figure 10 Amoeba  A singlecelled organism
constantly The shape of Amoeba changes because it can
animal
make its cytoplasm flow in any direction it wants to The
body of Amoeba has fingerlike projections which are called pseudopodia or false feet Amoeba can produce
pseudopodia on any side by pushing the cytoplasm in that side Amoeba moves very slowly with the help
of pseudopodia which keep on appearing and disappearing when it moves Amoeba also uses its
pseudopodia to catch food particles from the surroundings
Feeding and Digestion in Amoeba
Amoeba eats or feeds on tiny plants and animals present in pond water where it lives Amoeba takes
in food or ingests food by using pseudopodia When a food particle comes near Amoeba then Amoeba
Amoeba
grows

Figure 11 Different stages in the feeding and digestion in Amoeba
e
produces two pseudopodia around the food particle and surrounds it see Figure 11a The two
pseudopodia then join around the food particle and trap the food particle with a little water forming a food
vacuole inside the Amoeba see Figure 11b The food vacuole is like a temporary stomach of Amoeba The
food is digested in food vacuole This happens as follows  The surrounding cytoplasm secretes digestive
enzymes into the food vacuole see Figure 11b The digestive enzymes break the food particle into
simpler substances In this way the food gets digested The digested food present in food vacuole is
absorbed directly into the cytoplasm by the process of diffusion see Figure 11c After the absorption of
food the food vacuole disappears The absorbed food is used for the production of energy maintenance
and growth of Amoeba see Figure 11d Amoeba has no fixed place like anus for removing the undigested
food When a considerable amount of undigested food collects inside Amoeba then its cell membrane
suddenly ruptures at any place and the undigested food is thrown out or egested from the body of Amoeba
see Figure 11e
A similarity between the nutrition in Amoeba and human beings is that in both the cases digestive juices
break down the complex food particles into simpler substances which can be absorbed A difference is
that Amoeba has no mouth and no digestive system whereas a human being has a mouth and a digestive
system made up of many organs We are now in a position to answer the following questions

CHAPTER
Fibre To Fabric
atural fibres are threads obtained from plants and animals In Class VI we have learnt about some
fibres obtained from plants which are used to make fabric or cloth For example cotton plants give us
cotton fibres which are used for making cotton fabrics or cotton cloth Cotton flax and jute are all plant
fibres In this chapter we will study about the fibres which are obtained from animals and hence called
animal fibres The two important animal fibres are
1 Wool and
2 Silk
Wool comes from animals such as sheep goat and yak etc whereas silk comes from silkworms So
wool and silk are animal fibres Wool is used for knitting sweaters and weaving shawls and other woollen
cloth Silk is used for making saris and other dresses We will now discuss the production of wool and silk
in detail one by one Let us start with wool
WOOL
Wool is the most commonly used animal fibre Wool is the soft wavy or curly hair which covers the
body of a sheep Actually wool is a modified form of hair that grows with a waviness Because of the
waviness of wool the woollen fabrics have a greater bulk than cotton fabrics and hence trap more air Due
to this woollen fabrics keep us more warm during cold winter days Wool comes from sheep Actually
wool is obtained from the fleece or hair of sheep Sheep grow wool on their body and once a year this
wool is sheared cut off Though wool comes mainly from sheep some other animals also give us wool
This is discussed below
Animals That Yield Wool
Wool comes from the animals like sheep goat yak camel llama and alpaca In other words the woolyielding animals are sheep goat yak camel llama and alpaca see Figure 1 The woolyielding animals
bear a thick coat of hair on their body It is this hair which gives us wool Actually the woolyielding
b Goat
c Yak
d Camel
e Llama
Figure 1 The animals which provide us wool
f Alpaca
animals have a thick coat of hair on their body to keep them warm during cold winter season The hair
or wool trap a lot of air Air is a poor conductor of heat So the air trapped in hair or wool of these animals
prevents their body heat from being lost to cold surroundings and keeps them warm in winter This is why
the hair or wool of these animals is removed only once in a year at the beginning of summer season They
can survive in hot weather without hair And by the time winter comes the thick hair or wool grows
again on the body of these animals
Wool is most commonly obtained from sheep Sheep are reared in many parts of India for getting
wool The names of some of the breeds of sheep reared in our country for obtaining wool the quality of
wool obtained and the names of states where these sheep are found are given in the table below

The hairy skin of sheep has two types of fibres that form its fleece or wool coat i the coarse beard
hair and ii the fine soft underhair close to the skin The fine hair provide the fibres for making wool
Some breeds of sheep possess only fine underhair Their parent sheep are specially chosen so as to give
birth to sheep which have only soft underhair The process of selecting parent sheep for obtaining
special characteristics in their offspring such as soft underhair is called selective breeding The
natural colour of wool is generally creamy white though some breeds of sheep produce wool having brown
and black colours
Wool is also obtained from goat hair The underfur of Kashmiri goat is soft It is woven into fine
shawls called Pashmina shawls Angora wool is obtained from Angora goats which are found in the hilly
regions such as Jammu and Kashmir Yaks have thick and long hair on their body which yield wool Yak
wool is common in the hilly regions of Tibet and Ladakh The hair or fur on the body of camels are also
used as wool The animals called llama and alpaca which are found in South America have hair on their
body which are processed to yield wool Please note that though the hair on the body of animals such as
sheep goat and yak etc constitute wool but in everyday language wool means the processed wool
which is the wool yarn used for knitting sweaters or making shawls etc
PRODUCTION OF WOOL
Wool comes mainly from sheep In order to obtain wool sheep are reared and bred their hair is cut
and processed into wool We will first discuss the rearing and breeding of sheep and then describe how
the sheeps hair called fleece are cut and processed to make wool or wool yarn
Rearing and Breeding of Sheep
Rearing of sheep means to look after the sheep by providing them feed food shelter and health care
The persons who look after the sheep or rearers are called shepherds Sheep are herbivores and prefer to
eat grass and leaves So shepherds take the herds of sheep to countryside for grazing Apart from grazing
grass the sheep are also fed mixture of pulses corn jowar oil cakes oil cake is the material left after the
extraction of oil from oilseeds and minerals In winter sheep are kept indoors and fed on leaves grains
and dry fodder
Certain breeds of sheep have a thick coat of hair on their body which yields good quality wool in large
quantities These are called sheep of good breeds Such sheep are selectively bred by choosing at least one
parent sheep of good breed So the breeding of sheep is done to obtain such breeds of sheep which yield
good quality wool in large quantities This raises the quality and quantity of wool produced
Once the reared sheep have developed a thick coat of hair the hair is cut off for getting wool The cut
off wool coat of a sheep alongwith a thin layer of skin is called fleece The fleece consists of soft woollen fibres
The fleece of sheep is usually kept in one piece
How Wool is Obtained From Sheep
The yarn which we use for knitting sweaters or weaving shawls etc is called wool Wool is obtained
from the sheep by a long process which involves the following steps  Shearing Scouring Sorting Dyeing
Combing and Spinning We will now describe all these steps for obtaining wool one by one
i Shearing The hair of sheep alongwith a thin layer of skin called fleece are removed from the body
of sheep The process of removing hair or cutting off hair from the body of a sheep in the form of fleece
is called shearing see Figure 2 The hair of sheep are cut off
by using a cutting machine similar to that used by barbers
The hairy skin of sheep is removed in one piece and it is
called fleece Shearing does not hurt the sheep because the
uppermost layer of the skin of sheep is dead The shearing
cutting the hair of sheep is done in the hot weather of
summer so that sheep may survive without their protective
coat of hair The hair of sheep grow again before the onset of
winter and protect them in cold weather The fleece or hair
of sheep provide woollen fibres Woollen fibres are then
processed to obtain woollen yarn
ii Scouring The fleece of sheep or cut hair of sheep
contain dust dirt dried sweat and grease etc So the fleece
must be cleaned before it can be processed into wool yarn
The fleece or sheared hair of sheep is thoroughly cleaned by Figure 2 Shearing a sheep cutting the hair of
sheep alongwith a thin layer of skin in one piece
washing with soap or detergent and a lot of water in tanks
The process of washing the fleece cut hair of sheep
that removes dust dirt dried sweat and grease is
called scouring see Figure 3 Scouring makes the
fleece of sheep clean The scoured fleece or washed
fleece is then dried
iii Sorting The wool is not uniform in all the
parts of fleece of a sheep Some parts of fleece have fine
wool fibres whereas others have coarse wool fibres
Some parts of fleece have long wool fibres whereas
others have short wool fibres So the fleece of even
same sheep has wool of different qualities In sorting
the fleece is sent to a factory where it is broken and
separated into sections of different quality fibres The Figure 3 Scouring washing cut hair of sheep or fleece
process of separating the fleece of a sheep into with soap in a tank
sections according to the quality of woollen fibres
such as fine coarse long short etc is called sorting Every section of wool obtained after sorting
contains the same quality wool or uniform wool The same quality wool obtained from the fleece of large
number of sheep are then mixed together
iv Dyeing The natural fleece or hair of sheep or goats is white brown or black in colour The white
woollen fibres obtained by sorting can be dyed in different colours
v Combing Combing is a method to prepare woollen fibres for spinning the yarn This is done by
using combs having metal teeth The process of combing straightens the entangled woollen fibres and also
removes the small fluffy fibres called burrs which may be caught in them
vi Spinning The long woollen fibres are spun or twisted into thick yarn called wool which is
used for knitting sweaters etc The short woollen fibres are spun into fine yarn and then woven on a loom
to make woollen cloth like shawls etc
From the above discussion we conclude that the sheeps hair is sheared off from the body scoured
sorted dyed combed and spun to obtain wool for knitting sweaters and woollen yarn for weaving
woollen cloth The quality of woollen cloth depends on the breed of sheep from which wool is obtained
Occupational Hazard
Wool industry is an important source of livelihood for many people in our country The people who
do the job of sorting separating the fleece of sheep into fibres of different qualities are called sorters The
sorters job is very risky because sometimes they get infected by the bacteria called anthrax which cause a
deadly blood disease called sorters disease The risks faced by people working in any industry due to the
nature of their work are called occupational hazards Sorters disease is an occupational hazard
SILK
Silk is a fine strong soft and shining fibre produced by silkworms in making their cocoons Silk is
called resham in Hindi Silk is a natural fibre which is obtained from an insect called silk moth So silk is
an animal fibre Silk fibre is made of a protein Silk is the strongest natural fibre The soft looking silk yarn
is as strong as a comparable thread of steel  Silk fibres are converted into silk yarn which is used for
making silk cloth This silk cloth is then used for making saris and other dresses
The rearing of silkworms for obtaining silk is called sericulture Sericulture means silk farming
Sericulture is a very old occupation in India India produces a lot of silk on commercial scale Before we go
further and describe the process of obtaining silk it is necessary to know the life history of silk moth This
is described on the next page
Life History of Silk Moth
Silk moth is a kind of insect which resembles a butterfly Life history of silk moth is interesting
because silk moth is not formed as such from the eggs directly The silk moth passes through a wormlike
stage called larva or caterpillar which is also called silkworm and an encased form called pupa during
its development between the hatching of egg and formation of adult silk moth This can be written as
Egg
 Larva or Caterpillar
 Pupa
 Silk moth
Silkworm
Cocoon
The larva or caterpillar and pupa stages in the life history of a silk moth are totally different in
appearance from the adult silk moth It is the larva or caterpillar of a silk moth which produces silk and
not the adult silk moth The larva or caterpillar of a silk moth which produces silk is called silkworm
We can describe the life history of silk moth as follows
i The female silk moth lays eggs on the leaves of a tree such as mulberry tree see Figure 4a
ii The eggs hatch to form wormlike larvae see Figure 4b The larvae of silk moth are called
caterpillars or silkworms The silkworms feed on the leaves of mulberry tree and grow bigger in size Silk
is formed in liquid form in the two glands in the silkwormss head

Figure 4 Diagrams to show the life history of silk moth
iii When the silkworm or caterpillar is ready to enter the next stage of its development called pupa
it first weaves a net to hold itself Then it swings its head from side to side in the form of figure of eight
8 During these movements of head the silkworm secretes silk in liquid form through the tiny opening in
its head which solidifies on exposure to air and becomes a silk fibre or silk thread Soon the silkworm or
caterpillar covers itself completely by silk fibres The silky covering spun by the silkworm or caterpillar
of silk moth is called cocoon The cocoon is made by silkworm to protect its development as pupa Pupa
is a stage in the life history of silk moth when the caterpillar or silkworm becomes encased in a hard shell
of silk fibres called cocoon see Figure 4c The silkworm continues to develop in the form of pupa inside
the cocoon to form the silk moth
iv When the pupa encased in cocoon develops fully to form an adult silk moth then the cocoon
splits up and a beautiful silk moth comes out see Figure 4d The adult female silk moth then lays more
eggs In this way the life history of silk moth is completed
Please note that in order to produce silk the silkworm developing inside the cocoon as pupa is not
allowed to mature into an adult silk moth So as soon as the cocoon is formed it is used to obtain silk
fibres and the developing silkworm as pupa gets killed This is because if the silkworm as pupa is
allowed to mature into a silk moth then the fully formed silk moth secretes a liquid to dissolve a part of
silk of the cocoon to break it so as to come out of it and fly away This breaking of cocoon causes damage
to its silk threads and hence lowers the quality of silk This is why the cocoons having developing
silkworms inside them are used to obtain silk Some of the silkworms as pupae are however allowed to
live and mature into silk moths so that they can lay eggs to produce more silkworms Silk production
involves cultivation of mulberry trees and rearing of silkworms Mulberry is a small tree whose leaves are
used for feeding silkworms Mulberry is called shehtoot in Hindi We will now describe how silk is
actually produced
PRODUCTION OF SILK
In order to obtain silk mulberry trees are cultivated grown silkworms are reared and their cocoons
collected to get silk fibres We will now describe the rearing of silkworms processing of cocoons to obtain
silk fibres and making of silk fabrics silk cloth from silk fibres
i Rearing of Silkworms to Obtain Cocoons
A female silk moth lays hundreds of eggs at a time see Figure 5a The eggs of silk moths are stored
carefully on paper strips or cloth strips and sold to silkworm farmers The farmers keep these eggs at
suitable temperature and humidity under hygienic conditions The eggs are then warmed to a suitable
temperature for hatching When the eggs hatch silkworms larvae or caterpillars come out of eggs
b Silkworms hatched from eggs

a Female silk moth

c Cocoons of silk fibres
spun by silkworms
Figure 5 Production of silk
The silkworms are fed cutup mulberry leaves see Figure 5b The silkworms eat day and night and grow
big in size After about 25 to 30 days the silkworms stop eating and get ready to spin cocoons The
silkworms climb the twigs placed near them and spin cocoons of silk fibres The silkworms enclose
themselves completely inside the silken cocoons in two or three days see Figure 5c
ii Processing of Cocoons to Obtain Silk Fibres
All the cocoons are collected at one place The pile of cocoons is used for obtaining silk fibres This is
done as follows  The pile of cocoons is placed in hot water Hot water makes the silk fibres of cocoons to
separate out The long silk fibres are obtained by unwinding the threads from cocoons The process of
taking out silk fibres from the cocoons for use as silk is called reeling Reeling is done in special
machines which unwind the fibres of silk from cocoons
iii Converting Silk Fibres into Silk Cloth
Silk fibres obtained from cocoons are spun twisted to form silk threads called silk yarn The silk
yarn is then woven on looms into silk cloth by the weavers
Different Varieties of Silk
There is a variety of silk moths which look very different from one another The silk produced by the
silkworms of different varieties of silk moths is different in texture coarse smooth shiny etc Some of
the varieties of silk are  Mulberry silk Tassar silk  Mooga silk  Kosa silk  and Eri silk These silks are
obtained from cocoons spun by the silkworms of different types of silk moths The most common silk
moth is the mulberry silk moth The silk obtained from the cocoons of mulberry silk moth is called
mulberry silk Mulberry silk is soft lustrous shiny and elastic and can be dyed in beautiful colours Thus
the most common variety of silk is mulberry silk
Natural Silk and Artificial Silk
Natural silk is obtained from the cocoons of silkworms and it is made of a protein Natural silk is an
animal fibre Artificial silk called rayon is obtained from wood pulp and it is made of modified plant
material cellulose Paper is also made of cellulose obtained from wood pulp We can distinguish
between natural silk or pure silk and artificial silk by performing the burning test
ACTIVITY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN NATURAL SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK
Take a piece of natural silk fabric and another piece of artificial silk fabric burn them separately and
observe the smell produced
i The fabric which burns giving a smell of burning hair will be natural silk or pure silk
ii The fabric which burns giving a smell of burning paper will be artificial silk or rayon
Just like silk wool is also made of proteins So a piece of wool or woollen fabric also burns giving the
smell of burning hair
Discovery of Silk
The discovery of silk was made in China a long time back It is said that the Chinese empress SilungChi was asked by the emperor Huangti to find the cause of the damaged leaves of mulberry trees in their
garden The empress found some white worms eating up mulberry leaves She also noticed that these
worms were spinning shiny cocoons around them A cocoon dropped into her cup of tea accidently and
delicate silk threads separated from the cocoon This is how silk was discovered by chance The discovery
of silk led to the beginning of silk industry in China The silk production in China was kept a secret for
hundreds of years Later on traders and travellers coming from China introduced silk to other countries
The route on which they travelled is still called silk route Even today China leads the world in silk
production India is also among the leading silk producing countries of the world In India a large number
of women are engaged in various activities related to silk production such as rearing of silkworms reeling
of silk from cocoons and processing of raw silk into fabrics We are now in a position to answer the

CHAPTER
Heat
eat is a form of energy It makes a substance hotter Heat cannot be seen by us We can feel the
heat by the temperature effect it produces When heat is given to a substance its temperature
increases and it becomes hotter For example when a utensil is kept on a gas burner it gets heat
its temperature increases and it becomes hot On the other hand when heat is removed from a substance
then its temperature decreases and it becomes cold For example when water is kept in a refrigerator then
heat gets removed from water its temperature decreases and it becomes cold
HOT AND COLD
In our daily life we come across a number of objects Some of these objects are hot whereas other
objects are cold For example tea is hot but ice is cold soup is hot but ice cream is cold the spoon kept in
a cup of hot milk is hot whereas fruit juice is cold  a frying pan kept on a burning gas stove is hot but the
handle of frying pan is cold Even among the hot objects some objects may be hotter than the others
Similarly among the cold objects some objects may be colder than the others We usually decide whether
an object is hot or cold just by touching it provided it is not too hot or too cold Sometimes however our
sense of touch is not reliable in telling us whether an object is really hot or cold This point will become
more clear from the following activity
ACTIVITY
Take three bowls A B and C Put cold water in bowl A hot water in bowl B and lukewarm water slightly
warm water in bowl C see Figure 1
i We dip our left hand in cold water in bowl A and right hand in hot water in bowl B see Figure 1a
Keep the hands in this way for about 2 or 3 minutes
ii Now take out the hands from bowls A and B and dip both the hands quickly in lukewarm water in bowl
C see Figure 1b

Figure 1 Our sense of touch may misinform us about the temperature of an object here water
We will find that the water in third bowl C does not feel equally warm to both the hands To the left hand
which was earlier in cold water this lukewarm water appears to be hot But to the right hand which was
earlier in hot water this lukewarm water appears to be cold This however is impossible because the same
water cannot be hot as well as cold at the same time Actually our sense of touch is misinforming us in this
case
From the above activity we conclude that we cannot depend on our sense of touch for estimating the
hotness or coldness of an object We need some reliable measure for estimating the hotness or coldness
of an object A reliable measure of the hotness or coldness of an object is its temperature The
temperature of an object is measured by using a device called thermometer We will now discuss the
temperature and its measurement in detail
TEMPERATURE
If we touch a utensil kept on a burning gas stove it feels to be very hot We say that the temperature
of utensil is very high On the other hand if we touch a utensil placed in a refrigerator it feels to be very
cold And we say that the temperature of utensil is very low Thus a hot object has a high temperature
whereas a cold object has a low temperature This gives us the following definition of temperature  The
temperature of an object is the degree of hotness or coldness of the object The temperature of an object
tells us how hot or cold the object is A high temperature of an object tells us that it is very hot whereas a
low temperature of the object tells us that it is quite cold For example the temperature of boiling water is
hundred degrees Celsius 100C which is quite high So boiling water feels to be very hot On the other
hand the temperature of melting ice is zero degree Celsius0C which is quite low So ice feels to be very
cold to touch
Temperature is measured by using a device or instrument called thermometer A thermometer has
a scale marked on it which is used to read the temperature The most common temperature scale marked
on thermometers for measuring temperatures is the Celsius scale So the temperature is expressed in the
unit of degree Celsius which is written in short form as C In the unit C the small circle at the top
denotes the term degree and the letter C denotes Celsius So the unit C is read as degree Celsius or just
degree C In the Celsius scale of temperature the temperature of melting ice is given a value of 0C zero
degree Celsius and the temperature of boiling water or steam formed from it is given a value of 100C
hundred degrees Celsius The length of a laboratory thermometer tube between 0 mark and 100 mark
is divided into 100 equal divisions Each such division is called a degree Please note that the temperature
of an object should always be stated with its unit  C degree Celsius
MEASURING TEMPERATURE  THERMOMETERS
A thermometer is a device for measuring the temperature of an object There are two common types
of thermometers  Laboratory thermometer and Clinical thermometer Both these thermometers are based
on the Celsius scale of temperature The laboratory thermometer as well as clinical thermometer are
mercury thermometers When heat is supplied to the thermometer bulb containing mercury by the hot
body whose temperature is to be measured the mercury expands and rises in the glass tube of
thermometer This fact is used in measuring the temperature of the hot body or hot object We will now
describe the construction and working of a laboratory thermometer and a clinical thermometer in detail
one by one Let us discuss the laboratory thermometer first
Laboratory Thermometer
A laboratory thermometer is used for measuring the temperature in a science laboratory A laboratory
thermometer is made up of a long glass tube T having a thin bore in it see Figure 2 There is a glass bulb
B containing mercury which is joined at the lower end of the glass tube The top end of glass tube is sealed
after removing air The whole length
of thermometer glass tube is graduated
or calibrated in degrees Celsius The
graduations marked on the tube of a
commonly
used
laboratory
thermometer are from 10C to 110C
minus ten degree C to hundred ten
degree C So a common laboratory
thermometer
measure
temperatures from 10C to 110C
This is called the range of
thermometer Thus the range of a
laboratory thermometer is generally
from 10C to 110C see Figure 2
This means that a common laboratory
thermometer can measure a lowest
temperature of 10C and a highest
temperature of 110C If we look at the
temperature markings of say 0C and
10C on the thermometer tube we will
find that there are 10 small divisions
inbetween them see Figure 2 Now
since 10 small divisions on this
laboratory thermometer tube represent
a temperature of 10 degrees Celsius
therefore 1 small division on the
laboratory thermometer will represent
a temperature of 1 degree Celsius or
1C We can see a thin silvery thread
of mercury in the narrow glass tube of
the thermometer The upper end of this
mercury thread or column tells us the
temperature of the object in which the
thermometer bulb is placed
We will now describe how
temperature is measured by using a Figure 2 A laboratory
Figure 3Measuring temperature
laboratory thermometer We will thermometer
of hot water with a laboratory
measure the temperature of hot water
thermometer
kept in a beaker
Take a laboratory thermometer Hold the thermometer from its glass tube and immerse the bulb of
thermometer in hot water taken in a beaker see Figure 3 The bulb of thermometer should not touch the
sides or the bottom of the beaker We will see the shining thread of mercury moving up in the thermometer
tube After some time the mercury thread will stop rising and stand at one place So wait till the mercury
thread becomes steady We then read the temperature on thermometer tube which corresponds to the top of
mercury thread This will give us the temperature of hot water For example in Figure 3 the thermometer
shows that the temperature of hot water taken in the beaker is 80C Please note that whenever we measure
the temperature of hot water or anything else we should wait until the mercury stops rising in the
thermometer tube We should note down the temperature reading by keeping the thermometer bulb still
immersed in hot water This is because if the thermometer bulb is taken out of hot water its mercury thread
will start falling This will give a wrong reading for the temperature of hot water Another point to be noted is
that if we put the thermometer bulb in a beaker containing cold water then the mercury of thermometer bulb
will contract by losing heat and the level of mercury thread in the thermometer tube will fall showing a
lower temperature for cold water
Precautions in Using a Laboratory Thermometer
1 The laboratory thermometer should be held vertically or upright while measuring temperature It
should not be tilted
2 The thermometer bulb should be surrounded from all sides by the substance whose temperature is
to be measured
3 The thermometer bulb should not touch the sides or bottom of the container in which the substance
is taken
4 Read the thermometer while its bulb is still in touch with the substance whose temperature is being
measured
5 Read the thermometer by keeping the level of mercury along the line of sight
6 Do not hold the thermometer by the bulb
7 Handle the thermometer with care It can break if hit against any hard object
A laboratory thermometer cannot be used to measure the human body temperature This is because
as soon as we take out the bulb of the laboratory thermometer from our mouth the level of mercury in its
tube will start falling quickly due to cooling of its bulb by air This will give a wrong value of the body
temperature It is clear that for measuring the body temperature we should use a thermometer in which the
mercury level does not fall even when its bulb is removed from the mouth A clinical thermometer is such
a thermometer Before we describe the clinical thermometer we should know the meaning of the term
kink The kink is a narrow and sharp bend or curve in the bore of a clinical thermometer tube Kink is
also known as constriction The clinical thermometer is also called Doctors thermometer
CLINICAL THERMOMETER
The normal temperature of human body is 37C thirty seven degree Celsius When a person gets
fever his body temperature rises and he feels hot The thermometer used for measuring the temperature
of human body is called clinical thermometer A clinical thermometer is used to measure our body
temperature by a doctor or at home A clinical thermometer is shown in Figure 4 A clinical thermometer
consists of a long glass tube having a thin and uniform bore There is a glass bulb at one end of the glass
tube This glass bulb contains mercury Outside the glass bulb a small shining thread of mercury can be
seen in the thermometer tube see Figure 4 The other end of glass tube is sealed after removing air A
temperature scale is marked on the glass tube of the clinical thermometer The clinical thermometer has a
temperature scale marked from 35C to 42C see Figure 4
The clinical thermometer is a mercury thermometer which has been specially designed to measure the
temperature of human body A clinical thermometer has two special features which make it different from
the laboratory thermometer
i A clinical thermometer has a very short range of temperature from 35C to 42C see Figure 4 This
means that a clinical thermometer can measure temperatures only from 35C to 42C The short
range of a clinical thermometer is due to the fact that the temperature of human body normally does
not go below 35C or above 42C
ii A clinical thermometer has a kink or constriction in its glass tube just above the bulb containing
mercury see Figure 4 The kink is to prevent the back flow of mercury into the thermometer bulb
when the thermometer bulb is removed from the mouth of a patient The kink prevents the mercury
level in the thermometer tube from falling on its own So even when the thermometer bulb is
removed from the mouth of a patient the mercury thread will keep standing at the maximum level
reached Due to this we can read the correct body temperature of the patient even after removing the
thermometer bulb from his mouth After noting the body temperature the level of mercury can be
brought down by giving a few jerks to the thermometer tube
How to Use Clinical Thermometer to Measure Body Temperature
We can use a clinical thermometer to measure the body temperature of a patient as follows
ACTIVITY
1 Wash the thermometer properly preferably with an antiseptic solution If antiseptic solution is not
available wash it with clean water
2 Hold the thermometer tube firmly in your hand and give it a few jerks so that the mercury thread
in the thermometer tube falls below the reading of 35C Never hold a thermometer from its bulb
3 Put the bulb of the thermometer under the tongue of the patient and hold the thermometer tube gently
Keep the thermometer bulb in the mouth of the patient for about one minute Then take out the thermometer
from patients mouth
4 To read the temperature hold the thermometer horizontally in your hand and rotate it slowly A
position will come when you will see a magnified image of the mercury thread in its tube We read the
temperature on thermometer tube in level with the top of the mercury thread This will give the body
temperature of the patient
Precautions in Using a Clinical Thermometer
1 The clinical thermometer should be washed before and after use preferably with an antiseptic
solution
2 Before using the clinical thermometer we should ensure that the mercury level in its tube is below
35C mark
3 Read the clinical thermometer by keeping the level of mercury along the line of sight
4 The clinical thermometer should never be held by the bulb while reading it otherwise the bulb will
break

5 Handle the clinical thermometer with care The thermometer can break if it hits against some hard
object
If we look at the scale marked on the clinical thermometer tube we will find that the temperature
difference indicated by the two big marks say 37C and 38C is 1 degree see Figure 4 We will also see
that there are 10 small divisions between the 1 degree temperature Now since 10 small divisions
represent 1 degree C temperature therefore 1 small division represents

1
degree C temperature or 01
10
degree C temperature Thus with a clinical thermometer we can measure the human body temperature
accurately up to onetenth of a degree or 01C
A clinical thermometer has usually two temperature scales marked on its glass tube on the two
sides of the mercury thread  Celsius scale of temperature and Fahrenheit scale of temperature We have
not shown the Fahrenheit scale of temperature in Figure 4 to keep the diagram simple The Fahrenheit
scale of temperature marked on the clinical thermometer has a range of 94F to 108F F means degree
Fahrenheit The normal temperature of human body on Fahrenheit scale is 986F Fahrenheit scale of
temperature was used in earlier days India has now adopted the Celsius scale so we should read the
Celsius scale temperatures marked on the clinical thermometer
The normal temperature of human body is 37C By saying that the normal temperature of human
body is 37C we do not mean that each and every healthy person should have a body temperature of
exactly 37C Actually what we call normal temperature of human body 37C is the average body
temperature of a large number of healthy persons So the normal body temperature of every healthy
person may not be exactly 37C It could be slightly higher or slightly lower than 37C So as long as a
person is healthy he should not worry even if his body temperature as shown by the clinical thermometer
is slightly higher or lower than the standard body temperature of 37C
How Does a Clinical Thermometer Work
When we put the thermometer bulb in the mouth of a patient then some of the body heat of patient is
transferred to the mercury in the thermometer bulb This heat makes the liquid mercury of the
thermometer bulb to expand increase in volume due to which the mercury thread is pushed to a higher
level in the thermometer tube Higher the fever of a patient greater will be his body heat and hence higher
will be the level of mercury or higher will be the temperature shown by the thermometer
A clinical thermometer cannot be used to measure high temperatures because it has been designed
to measure only human body temperature which varies over a short range If a clinical thermometer is used
to measure high temperatures it will get damaged For example we should not measure the temperature
of hot milk by using a clinical thermometer This is because the temperature of hot milk is very high due
to which it will cause a large expansion of mercury And since there is no extra space in the glass tube of
clinical thermometer to accommodate large expansion of mercury the thermometer tube will break We
should also avoid keeping the clinical thermometer in the hot sunshine or near other hot objects like a
flame It may break under these conditions
Comparison Between Clinical Thermometer and Laboratory Thermometer
A similarity between clinical thermometer and laboratory thermometer is that both are mercuryinglass thermometers The differences between a clinical thermometer and a laboratory thermometer are as
follows
i The clinical thermometer has a very short temperature range 35C to 42C whereas a laboratory
thermometer has a large temperature range usually from 10C to 110C
ii The clinical thermometer has a kink or constriction in its tube to prevent the back flow of mercury
into the bulb whereas a laboratory thermometer has no kink
iii The clinical thermometer measures temperature more accurately up to 01C than a laboratory
thermometer which usually measures up to 1C
Digital Thermometers
Most of the common thermometers are mercury
thermometers which use a liquid metal called mercury for
their working Mercury is a toxic substance poisonous
substance and hence it is very difficult to dispose of safely if
a thermometer breaks So there is a lot of concern over the
Figure 5 A digital thermometer
use of mercury in thermometers These days digital
thermometers are available which do not use mercury see Figure 5
TRANSFER OF HEAT
MaximumandMinimum Thermometer
The maximum temperature of the day usually reaches in the afternoon whereas the minimum
temperature usually occurs in the early morning In weather forecasting and other meteorological work it
is necessary to know the highest and the lowest temperatures reached in the surroundings during a whole
day There is a special thermometer called maximumandminimum thermometer which automatically
records the maximum and minimum temperatures of the day The maximum and minimum temperatures
of the previous day reported in weather reports in TV and newspapers are measured by the maximumand
minimum thermometer
To carry heat from one part of an object to its other part or from one object to another object is
called transfer of heat For example if we dip a steel spoon in a cup of hot tea we find that the
temperature of spoon rises and it becomes hot Here some of the heat contained in hot tea has been
transferred to spoon which is placed in it In this example heat moves from hot tea to the cold spoon We
know that a utensil like a frying pan becomes hot when kept on the flame of a gas burner of the stove
This is because heat from the hot flame is transferred to the cold utensil And when a hot utensil is removed
from the gas burner it cools down slowly In this case heat is transferred from the hot utensil to the
surroundings
In general we can say that  Heat flows from a hot object to a cold object In other words heat flows
from an object at higher temperature to another object at lower temperature The flow of heat or transfer
of heat stops when the two objects attain the same temperature This means that no heat will be transferred
from one object to another if the temperature of the two objects is the same or equal For example if an
iron ball at a temperature of 40C is dropped into a bucket containing water at the same temperature of
40C then heat will not flow either from iron ball to water or from water to iron ball because both the iron
ball and water are at the same temperature of 40C We will now describe the various ways in which heat
can be transferred from a hot object to a cold object
Heat can be transferred from a hot object to a cold object in three different ways
i by conduction
ii by convection and
iii by radiation or heat rays
In solids heat is transferred by conduction In liquids and gases heat is transferred by convection And in
empty space or vacuum having no medium like solid liquid or gas heat is transferred by radiation We will
now describe conduction convection and radiation in detail one by one Let us start with conduction

CONDUCTION
If we heat one end of a metal spoon by keeping it over a gas burner we find that its other end also
becomes hot after a while see Figure 6 In this case heat is transferred from the hot end of the metal spoon
to its cold end Now when heat is transferred from the hotter end of spoon to its colder end there is no
movement of the material of the spoon which is metal from one end to another Such a transfer of heat

from the hot part of a material to its colder part without
the movement of material as a whole is called
conduction In the above case the transfer of heat by
conduction takes place within the same object same
spoon Now if we bring the hot end of the spoon in
contact with the cold end of another spoon by touching
them with each other we will find that some of the heat
of the hot spoon is transferred to the cold spoon due to
which the cold spoon also becomes somewhat hot see
Figure 7 Such a transfer of heat from a hot spoon to a
Figure 7 Conduction of heat from a hot metal spoon to a cold metal spoon which is in contact with it
cold spoon which are in contact with each other is also called conduction We can now define the process
of heat transfer called conduction as follows
Conduction is the transfer of heat from the hotter part of a material to its colder part or from a hot
material to a cold material in contact with it without the movement of material as a whole In all the
solids heat is transferred by the process of conduction Here are some examples of transfer of heat by
conduction from our everyday life A cold metal spoon dipped in a hot cup of tea gets heated by
conduction In this case hot tea acts only as a source of heat A frying pan kept on a gas stove transfers
the heat of gas burner through its metal bottom by the process of conduction We will now describe an
activity to demonstrate the process of conduction of heat
ACTIVITY TO SHOW THE CONDUCTION OF HEAT
We take a flat aluminium rod and fix some small iron nails on it with the help of wax This rod alongwith
its iron nails is clamped to a stand as shown in Figure 8
Let us heat the free end left end of the aluminium
rod by keeping a burner below it We will see that the
iron nails attached to aluminium rod with wax start
falling one by one The nail attached nearest to the
heated end of rod falls down first And then the next
ones fall But the nail attached to the clamped end of the
rod drops last of all These observations can be
explained as follows
The burner is placed below the left end of
aluminium rod So the left end of aluminium rod gets
Figure 8 Activity to show conduction of heat
heated first Now the left end of aluminium rod is hot
but the right end of rod is cold So heat is now transferred from the hotter left end of aluminium rod to its
colder right end As heat travels from the left side to the right side along the aluminium rod it melts the wax
which holds the nails Due to this the nails fall down one by one From this activity we conclude that heat is
transferred from the hot end of aluminium rod to its colder end by the process of conduction
The transfer of heat by the process of conduction takes place only in solids This can be explained
as follows  In solids the particles are closely packed together During conduction heat is transferred from
particle to particle by means of back and forth vibrations of the particles caused by the heat energy The
particles of a solid remain at their fixed positions There is no actual movement of the particles of the solid
from its hotter end to the colder end during the conduction of heat through it
Good Conductors of Heat and Poor Conductors of Heat
Some materials conduct heat easily whereas other materials do not conduct heat easily So on the basis
of conduction of heat all the materials are classified into two groups
1 Good conductors of heat and
2 Poor conductors of heat
Good conductors of heat are sometimes called just conductors of heat Poor conductors of heat are
also called insulators of heat This classification will become more clear from the following activity
Beaker
We take a beaker and fill it half with hot water Let us take
two spoons one made of metal such as steel and the other
made of plastic Place the metal spoon and the plastic spoon in
the beaker containing hot water as shown in Figure 9 After
about two minutes we touch the top ends of both the spoons
with our hand one by one We will find that the top end of
metal spoon feels quite hot but the top end of plastic spoon
does not feel hot This is because heat from the hot water flows
easily through the metal spoon and reaches its other end But
the heat does not flow easily through the plastic spoon due to
which its other end remains almost cold This activity tells us
that metal spoon is a good conductor of heat whereas plastic
spoon is a poor conductor of heat or bad conductor of heat
We say that plastic is an insulator of heat
ACTIVITY
Figure 9 Metal spoon is a good conductor of
heat Plastic spoon is a poor conductor of heat
Those materials which allow heat to pass through them easily are called good conductors of heat or
just conductors of heat All the metals are good conductors of heat For example the metals such as
silver copper aluminium iron and mercury are all good conductors of heat Though all the metals are
good conductors of heat some metals are better conductors of heat than others For example silver metal
is the best conductor of heat Copper is one of the best conductors of heat Aluminium is also a very good
conductor of heat Metal alloys such as brass steel and stainless steel are also good conductors of heat
Copper is a much better conductor of heat than stainless steel All the objects made of metals and metal
alloys are also good conductors of heat Since metals and their alloys are good conductors of heat therefore
if one end of an object made of metal or metal alloy is heated then its other end becomes hot very quickly
Stone marble etc and tiles are also quite good conductors of heat
Those materials which do not allow heat to pass through them easily are called poor conductors of
heat The materials which are poor conductors of heat are called insulators So a poor conductor of heat is
an insulator of heat Some of the examples of poor conductors of heat or insulators of heat are  plastic
wood paper cloth leather cotton wool thermocol rubber asbestos clay bricks cork cane bamboo
straw sawdust glass fibreglass water and air In general liquids are poor conductors of heat and gases
are very poor conductors of heat For example water is a poor conductor of heat and air is a very poor
conductor of heat In fact air is a very good insulator of heat The materials which trap air such as cotton
wool fur feathers fibreglass and plastic foam are very poor conductors of heat In other words materials
having trapped air in them are excellent insulators of heat If one end of an object made of a poor conductor
material or insulator material is heated then its other end does not become hot It either remains almost
cold or becomes only slightly hot
Uses of Good Conductors and Poor Conductors of Heat
We make use of good conductors of heat as well as of poor conductors of heat or insulators of heat
in many ways in our daily life Good conductors are used to carry heat quickly where it is wanted Poor
conductors or insulators are used to stop heat from going where it is not wanted Some of the examples
of the use of good conductors and poor conductors of heat are given below
The cooking utensils are made of metals or metal alloys This is because metals and metal alloys
are good conductors of heat which transfer the heat from the gas stove quickly to the food placed inside
the utensil through their bottom see Figure 10 The cooking utensils are provided with handles made
of plastic or wood This is because plastic or wood is a poor conductor of heat or insulator of heat see
Figure 10 A plastic or wooden handle prevents the heat from hot cooking utensil reaching our hand so
that we can lift the hot cooking utensil safely from its handle without the risk of burning our hand For
example a frying pan is made of aluminium metal or stainless steel because aluminium metal and
a Frying pan
b Pressure cooker
Figure 10 Cooking utensils are made of good conductors of heat but their handles are made of poor
conductors of heat or insulators
stainless steel are good conductors of heat which conduct the heat from gas burner of stove quickly through
their bottom to the food kept inside see Figure 10a The handle of a frying pan is made of plastic or
wood because plastic or wood is a poor conductor of heat or insulator of heat The plastic handle or
wooden handle does not conduct the heat of hot frying pan to its other end so that we can hold even the
hot frying pan from its handle safely see Figure 10a Some stainless steel frying pans are provided with
copper bottoms The reason for this is that copper metal is a much better conductor of heat than stainless
steel due to which it can transfer the heat of gas stove burner to the food kept inside much more quickly
Mercury metal is used in making thermometers because it is a good conductor of heat The handle
of a soldering iron is made of wood or plastic because wood or plastic is a poor conductor of heat The
wooden or plastic handle does not conduct the heat of hot soldering iron to our hand so that we can hold
the hot soldering iron safely from its handle An electric iron is also provided with a plastic handle so that
when electric iron gets hot its plastic handle being a poor conductor of heat remains cold and can be held
safely with our hand Table mats are usually made of poor conductors or insulators such as plastic or cork
to protect the table tops from hot dishes
Why Do We Wear Woollen Clothes in Winter
We wear woollen clothes in winter when it is cold outside Woollen clothes keep us warm during cold
winter days This happens as follows  Wool is a poor conductor of heat due to which woollen clothes stop
the flow of heat from our warm body to the cold surroundings Moreover there is air trapped inbetween
the fibres of the woollen clothes Air is a very poor conductor of heat So the air trapped in fibres of
woollen clothes also stops the flow of heat from our warm body to the cold surroundings Since our body
does not lose its heat we feel warm on wearing woollen clothes in winter A woollen blanket also keeps us
warm on a cold winter night in a similar way
If we are given the choice in winter of using either one thick woollen blanket or two thin woollen
blankets joined together then we should prefer two thin woollen blankets joined together This is
because the two thin woollen blankets joined together will have a layer of air trapped inbetween them
And this extra layer of trapped air being a very poor conductor of heat will prevent our body heat from
going away to the cold air more efficiently and hence keep us more warm The single thick woollen blanket
does not have this extra layer of air in it In fact wearing more layers of clothes keeps us warmer in winter
than wearing just one thick piece of clothing This is because more layers of clothes trap more air in them
and air being a very poor conductor of heat prevents our body heat from going away to cold surroundings
The feathers of birds keep them warm in cold weather due to air trapped in them Air being a very
poor conductor of heat prevents the body heat of birds from escaping to the cold surroundings and hence
keeps the birds warm in cold weather Similarly the animals having fur such as polar bear keep warm in
cold weather because their fur traps a lot of air which is an excellent insulator of heat
During the hot summer days we use electricity to run fans coolers and air conditioners to keep our
house cool And in cold winter days we use electricity to run room heaters or burn fuels like coal or
charcoal to keep our house warm In this way a lot of energy is used up to protect us from outside heat or
cold and keep us comfortable in summer as well as in winter It is now possible to construct houses and
other buildings in such a way that they are not affected much by the heat or cold outside This can be
done by constructing the outer walls of houses or other buildings by using hollow bricks which contain
trapped air Since the hollow bricks contain a very poor conductor of heat air trapped in them the walls
made of hollow bricks will neither allow outside heat to come in during summer nor allow inside heat to
go out during winter This will save a lot of electrical energy as well as other fuels which are otherwise
used in keeping houses cool or warm
Sometimes two things which are at the same temperature feel like they are at different
temperatures  one being cold and the other being warm This happens because some things are good
conductors of heat whereas others are poor conductors of heat Here is an example During winter season
a metal object kept in a room feels very cold to touch but a wooden object in the same room feels warmer
to touch This can be explained as follows  Metal object is a good conductor of heat So when we touch the
metal object it conducts away heat from our hand quickly And by losing heat our hand feels cold On the
other hand the wooden object being a poor conductor of heat does not allow the heat of our hand to
escape and hence feels warmer to touch
CONVECTION
We have just studied that the transfer of heat in solids takes place by the process of conduction The
transfer of heat in liquids and gases however takes place by the process of convection
Convection is the transfer of heat from the hotter parts of a liquid or gas to its colder parts by the
movement of the liquid or gas itself The transfer of heat by convection can take place only in liquids and gases
because the particles in liquids and gases can move about freely In convection the particles of a liquid or gas
actually move from the hotter regions to the colder regions to transfer heat The transfer of heat by
convection cannot take place in solids because the particles in the solids are fixed at a place and hence
cannot move about freely The transfer of heat by convection also cannot take place in empty space called
vacuum because there are no particles of any kind in empty space which can move and transfer heat
We will now describe the transfer of heat by convection through the most common liquid around us
called water and the most common gas around us called air one by one Before we do that please note
that hot water is lighter less dense than cold water Similarly hot air is lighter less dense than cold air
CONVECTION IN WATER
Water is a poor conductor of heat so it cannot transfer heat by conduction Water transfers heat by
the process of convection In order to heat water we keep the vessel containing water over a gas burner
ACTIVITY TO SHOW CONVECTION CURRENTS
DURING HEATING OF WATER
Now though the burner is kept at the bottom of the vessel
but it still heats all the water in the vessel Actually when
water is heated in a vessel it transfers heat from its hotter
parts just above the flame of burner to its colder parts by the
process of convection This happens as follows
When a beaker containing water is kept over a burner
water at the bottom of beaker near the flame gets heated
expands and becomes lighter This hot water being lighter
rises upwards and carries heat alongwith it see Figure 11
The cold water from above being denser sinks downwards
to take the place of hot rising water see Figure 11 This cold
Figure 11 The water in a beaker is heated by
water then gets heated by the burner and also rises upwards
convection currents
carrying its heat upwards And more cold water sinks
downwards This process of hot water rising upwards and cold water sinking downwards takes place again and again
due to which the whole water in the beaker gets heated uniformly The circulatory movements of water in the
beaker in which hot water rises and cold water sinks again and again are called convection currents
These convection currents transfer heat from water at the bottom of the beaker to the top of beaker rapidly
The arrows drawn in the beaker in Figure 11 show the direction of convection currents which take place
during the heating of water We can now say that water in a beaker is heated by convection currents
Round
bottomed
flask
We can see the path of convection currents of hot and cold
water taking place during the heating of water by dropping a
Water
crystal of a coloured substance called potassium permanganate
into the water to colour it This can be done as follows
We take a roundbottomed flask and fill it half with water A

movement of this hot water which has been coloured purple by
dissolved potassium permanganate crystal We will see the purple

streaks of hot water rise from the bottom of flask up to the surface
of water and then sink downward near the walls of the flask as
shown in Figure 12 These purple coloured streaks seen in the
water of flask which is being heated from below show the Figure 12 Activity to show the convection
convection currents taking place in the water of flask which currents taking place during the heating of
water which transfer heat from bottom to the
transfer heat from the bottom to the top
top

Water is a good convector of heat Water can transfer heat by convection only in the upward direction
because hot water being lighter than cold water rises upward in the vessel This is why we heat a vessel
containing water from below by keeping a burner at its bottom The heating element of an electric kettle
used for boiling water to make tea is also fixed at the bottom of the kettle Please note that convection
does not occur if the water is heated at the top rather than at the bottom If the water taken in a vessel is heated
by a burner at the top then the hot water being lighter stays at the top of the vessel Since no hot water
from top can sink downwards towards the bottom of the vessel the water at the bottom of such a vessel
which is being heated at the top will remain cold
CONVECTION IN AIR
Air is a very poor conductor of heat so air cannot transfer heat by the process of conduction Air
transfers heat from its hotter parts to colder parts by the process of convection by moving itself In
order to heat air in a room during winter we keep the heater on the floor usually in a corner of the room
Now though the heater is placed on the floor at the bottom of the room but it still heats all the air in the
room Actually when air is heated by the heater in one part of the room it transfers heat by convection
This happens as follows
When the heater kept on the floor in a room is switched on the air near the heater gets heated expands
and become lighter This hot air being lighter rises above the
top of the heater and carries its heat alongwith it see Figure
13 The cold air from above being denser sinks downwards
to the bottom of the heater to take the place of hot rising air
see Figure 13 This cold air also gets heated by the heater and
rises upwards carrying its heat upwards And more cold air
sinks downwards towards the heater This process of hot air
rising upwards and cold air sinking downwards takes place
again and again due to which all the air in the room gets
Figure 13 The air in a room is heated by
heated uniformly after some time The circulatory movements
convection currents
of air in the room in which hot air rises and cold air sinks
again and again are called convection currents Thus a room
heater heats all the air in a room by setting up convection currents in the air
ACTIVITY TO SHOW THE TRANSFER OF HEAT IN AIR BY CONVECTION
Fix a lighted candle on a table Keep one hand at a safe distance above the flame of the candle and the
other hand on the side of the flame as shown in Figure 14 We will find that the hand kept above the candle
flame feels quite hot but the hand kept on the side of the flame does not
feel so hot This can be explained as follows  The air just above the
candle flame gets heated first This hot air being lighter rises upwards
carrying the heat alongwith it The cold air from above being denser
sinks downwards to take the place of hot rising air This cold air also gets
heated by the flame and rises upwards And more cold air sinks
downwards to take its place This process of hot air rising up and cold air
moving down is repeated continuously In this way convection currents
are set up in the air above the candle flame which carry more and more
heat upwards This transfer of heat by moving air makes our hand kept
above the candle flame feel very hot
Air can transfer the heat of a source by convection only in the
upward direction because hot air being lighter rises in the upward
direction Air cannot transfer the heat from a source by convection either
on the sides or in the downward direction below the source of heat Figure 14 The air above the candle
This means that no convection currents of hot air take place on the sides flame gets heated by convection
of candle flame in the above activity due to which the hand kept on the
side of the flame does not feel so hot Whatever small heat is felt by the hand kept on the side of the candle
flame is due to the transfer of heat of candle flame by the process of radiation which we will study after a
while Convection currents in air also occur in nature which lead to the blowing of seabreeze and landbreeze in coastal areas
Blowing of SeaBreeze and LandBreeze
Gentle wind is called breeze The people living in coastal areas seaside areas experience an
interesting phenomenon called seabreeze and landbreeze which are based on the transfer of heat in air by
convection currents This happens as follows
During day time when the sun shines the solid land gets heated to a higher temperature much more
quickly than the liquid seawater The hot air over the land rises upwards and cooler air from over the sea

Figure 15 Seabreeze blows during the day
moves towards the land in the form of a cool breeze to take the place of hot rising air see Figure 15 The
breeze blowing from the sea towards the land is called seabreeze The cool seabreeze blows only during
the day time when the land is hotter than the sea To receive the cool seabreeze during the day the
windows of houses in coastal areas are made to face the sea
At night time the hot land cools much faster than the warm seawater Due to this the land becomes
cool very quickly but the seawater remains warm for a much longer time So during night the hot air over

RADIATION
When we switch on an electric bulb it becomes hot and gives out heat and light Now if we keep our
hand a short distance below the glowing bulb we can feel its heat on the hand see Figure 17 This means
that the hot glowing bulb is transferring some of its heat to our hand
held below it The hot electric bulb cannot transfer its heat to our hand
by conduction because air is a poor conductor of heat The hot bulb also
cannot transfer its heat to our hand by convection because the
convection currents of air always carry heat in the upward direction but
our hand is held below the bulb The hot electric bulb transfers its
bulb
heat to our hand held below it by the process called radiation Please
note that even if there is no air in the room the hot electric bulb can
transfer its heat to our hand by radiation In fact all the hot objects
whether solids liquids or gases can transfer heat by radiation This
happens as follows
Heat is
Every hot object emits gives out invisible heat rays in all
felt by
directions These heat rays carry heat energy When these heat rays fall
hand
on a cold object the cold object receives heat energy and gets heated In
this way heat energy is transferred from hot object to cold object by Figure 17 Heat is transferred from
bulb to our hand by radiation
means of heat rays This method of transfer of heat energy by heat rays
is called radiation Heat can be transferred from a hot body to a cold body by
radiation even if there is no material medium like solid liquid or gas between them In other words heat can be
transferred by radiation even through vacuum or empty space We can now define radiation as follows
Radiation is the transfer of heat energy from a hot body to a cold body by means of heat rays without
any material medium between them The best example of radiation is the transfer of heat energy of the sun
to the earth When we come out in the sunshine we feel hot This means that the heat from the sun is being
transferred to us which makes us feel hot We will now describe how heat from the sun reaches us on the
earth
How Does Heat From the Sun Reach on the Earth
The sun is very far away from the earth and there is mainly empty space vacuum between the sun
and the earth see Figure 18 Even then heat from the sun reaches the earth Now heat from the sun cannot
reach the earth by conduction or convection because both these processes require a
material medium like solid liquid or gas to transfer heat  they cannot take place
in empty space or vacuum Heat from the sun reaches on the earth by the
process of radiation This happens as follows
The sun is an extremely hot object The sun emits heat radiations or heat rays
in all directions These heat radiations travel through vacuum between the sun and
the earth at a very high speed and reach us on the earth When the suns radiations
fall on the earth and its objects they receive heat energy and hence get heated
Thus the suns heat reaches the earth by the process of radiation The invisible
heat rays which transfer heat by radiation are called infrared rays
We have just said that the transfer of heat from a hot object to a cold object by
the process of radiation does not require any medium It can take place whether a
medium is present or not Now though the heat from the sun reaches us mostly
through empty space or vacuum having no air etc but in our day to day life we Figure 18 Heat is
have many situations where heat is transferred by radiation through a medium transferred from the
called air In all the following examples heat is transferred by radiation through sun to the earth by the
process of radiation
air
1 When we stand next to a burning fire we can feel the heat of the fire falling on our face The heat is
transferred from the fire to our face by the process of radiation
2 When we sit in front of a roomheater we get heat directly by the process of radiation
3 A hot utensil say filled with hot milk kept away from the flame cools down by transferring its heat
to the surroundings by radiation
4 Depending on the temperature of surroundings our body too gives heat to the surroundings or
receives heat from the surroundings by radiation
Absorbers of Heat Radiations
The amount of heat which an object can absorb by radiation depends on the colour of the object The
objects having dark colours absorb more heat radiations than the objects having light colours We will
now describe an activity to show that objects having dark colour are better absorbers of heat than the objects
having light colour on their surfaces In this activity we will take a black painted tin can as an example of
dark coloured object and a white painted tin can as an example of light coloured object Let us describe the
activity now
ACTIVITY
We take a black painted tin can and a white tin can of the same size and place them on two wooden
blocks separately as shown in Figure 19 Pour equal amounts of water in both the tin cans and fix
thermometers in them with the help of rubber corks The initial temperatures of water in both the tin cans are
noted Their initial temperatures will be exactly equal

We place both the tin cans in bright sunshine for one hour The heat radiations of sun will fall equally
on both the tin cans After one hour we note down the temperatures of water in both the tin cans again We
will find that water in black tin can is at a higher temperature than in white tin can see Figure 19 Since the
temperature of water in black tin can is higher it shows that the black coloured tin can has absorbed more
heat of the sun And the lower temperature of water in the white tin can shows that the white coloured tin
can absorbs less heat from the sun From this activity we conclude that a black object absorbs more heat
radiations than a white object Since a black object is a good absorber of heat radiations it also means that
a black object is a bad reflector of heat radiations On the other hand since a white or silvery object is a
poor absorber of heat radiations it means that a white or silvery object is a good reflector of heat radiations
Emitters of Heat Radiations
The amount of heat which a hot object can emit give out by radiation also depends on the colour of
the object The hot objects having dark colours emit more heat radiations than the hot objects having
light colours We will now describe an activity to show that the objects having dark colours are better
emitters of heat than objects having light colour on their surfaces
ACTIVITY
We take a black tin can and a white tin can of the same size These tin cans are placed on wooden
blocks separately and kept in a shady place inside a room see Figure 20 Both the tin cans are filled with
the same hot water We note the initial temperatures of hot water in both the tin cans Their initial
temperatures are exactly equal

Allow both the tin cans to stand for ten minutes After ten minutes note the temperatures of water in
both the tin cans again We will find that the water in black tin can is at a lower temperature than the water
in white tin can see Figure 20 This means that the black coloured tin can has lost heat faster than the white
coloured tin can Thus a black object is a better emitter of heat On the other hand the higher temperature
of water in white tin can shows that the white coloured tin can has lost heat slowly Thus a white object is
a poor emitter of heat In other words a white object loses heat slowly
From the above two activities we conclude that black objects absorb heat better and also emit heat
better than white objects In general we can say that dark coloured objects absorb heat better and also
emit heat better than light coloured objects A yet another way of saying this is that dark coloured objects
are poor reflectors of heat but light coloured objects are good reflectors of heat
Importance of Colour of Objects in Everyday Life
We will now describe some everyday situations where colour of the object plays an important role We
use dark coloured objects where we want to absorb more heat and light coloured objects where less heat
is desired This point will become more clear from the following examples
1 Colour of Clothes People prefer to wear white clothes or light coloured clothes in the hot summer
days because white clothes or light coloured clothes absorb less heat from the sun In fact white clothes
or light coloured clothes reflect most of the suns heat rays which fall on them and keep us cool and
comfortable in hot weather For example in summer a white shirt reflects the suns heat rays and makes
us stay cooler People prefer to wear dark coloured clothes in the cold winter days This is because dark
coloured clothes absorb more heat rays from the sun and keep us warm in winter season For example a
black shirt worn in winter absorbs the suns heat rays more efficiently and keeps us warm
2 Colour of Houses The houses in hot sunny countries like ours are usually painted white or with
light colours from outside This is because a house painted white or with light colours absorbs very little
suns heat rays it reflects most of the suns heat rays This keeps the house cool in the hot days of summer
3 Solar Cooker and Solar Water Heater The box of solar cooker and solar water heater is painted
black from inside This is because a black surface is a very good absorber of heat and it will absorb
maximum heat radiations coming from the sun

CHAPTER
5 Acids Bases and Salts
Acids bases and salts are the three important groups of chemical compounds or chemical
substances which are useful to us in many ways For example our stomach makes an acid
hydrochloric acid which is necessary for the digestion of food  baking soda sodium
hydrogencarbonate used in baking bread is a base  whereas common salt sodium chloride used in
cooking food is a salt Some of the acids bases and salts occur in nature whereas many acids bases and
salts are made artificially in factories There are however many other chemical compounds such as
water glucose canesugar urea etc which are neither acids nor bases nor salts In this Chapter we will
study only acids bases and salts In order to find out whether a substance is an acid or base we should
first know the meaning of the term acidbase indicator or just indicator Indicators are special type of
chemicals which are used to test whether a given substance is an acid or base Indicators change their
colour when added to a solution containing an acid or a base We will now discuss the various types of
indicators in detail
INDICATORS FOR TESTING ACIDS AND BASES
An indicator is a dye that changes colour when it is put into an acid or a base An indicator gives
different colours in acid and base Thus an indicator tells us whether the substance we are testing is an
acid or a base by change in its colour A substance which contains an acid is said to be acidic whereas the
substance which contains a base is said to be basic So we can also say that an indicator tells us whether the
substance we are testing is acidic or basic by change in its colour Acidbase indicators are of two types  Natural
indicators and Synthetic indicators
i Litmus China rose and Turmeric are naturally occurring indicators
ii Phenolphthalein is a synthetic indicator
We will now describe how these indicators are prepared and how they help us in finding out whether
a given substance is an acid or a base acidic or basic
1 Litmus
Litmus is a natural indicator Litmus solution is a purple coloured dye
which is extracted from a type of plant called lichen see Figure 1 Litmus
has a purple colour mauve colour in water In other words when litmus
solution is neither acidic nor basic it is neutral then its colour is purple
When litmus is added to an acidic solution it turns red And when
litmus is added to a basic solution it turns blue Though the natural
colour of litmus is purple it is made into blue litmus and red litmus for the
sake of convenience in detecting colour change when an acid or base is
added to it Thus litmus is made into two types  Blue litmus and Red
litmus Litmus can be used in the form of litmus solution like blue litmus
solution and red litmus solution or in the form of strips of litmus paper
blue litmus paper and red litmus paper The blue litmus paper strip and Figure 1 Lichens from which
red litmus paper strip are shown in Figure 2
litmus indicator is extracted

b Red litmus paper

a Blue litmus paper
Figure 2
Litmus is the most common indicator for testing acids and bases in the laboratory
i Acids turn blue litmus to red
ii Bases turn red litmus to blue
So a convenient way to find out whether a solution is acidic or basic is to test it with blue litmus paper
and red litmus paper turn by turn and observe the change in colour which takes place
a If a drop of the given solution turns blue litmus paper to red then the given solution will be acidic in
nature or it will be an acid
For example a drop of lemon juice turns blue litmus paper to red so lemon juice is acidic in nature
That is lemon juice contains an acid
b If a drop of the given solution turns red litmus to blue then the given solution will be basic in nature
or it will be a base
For example a drop of baking soda solution turns red litmus paper to
blue so baking soda is basic in nature That is baking soda is a base
Please note that in order to test a solid substance with dry litmus paper
it is necessary to make a solution of the solid substance in water otherwise
the colour change will not take place For example solid baking soda will not
turn dry red litmus paper blue We have to first make a solution of baking
soda in water and then use it for testing with red litmus paper A drop of
baking soda solution will turn red litmus paper to blue
2 China Rose Indicator
China rose is also a natural indicator China rose is called Gudhal in Figure 3 China rose flower
Hindi China rose indicator is a light pink coloured solution which is from which china rose
extracted from the red flowers of China rose plant with water see Figure 3 indicator is extracted

ACTIVITY
We can make the China rose indicator ourselves as follows  Collect some petals of China rose flower and
place them in a beaker Add some warm water Keep the China rose petals immersed in water for some time
till water in the beaker acquires a light pink colour Remove the petals by filtration The light pink solution thus
obtained is the China rose indicator This China rose indicator can now be used for testing acids and bases

66
i Acids turn China rose indicator to magenta deep pink
ii Bases turn China rose indicator to green
So another way to find out whether a solution is acidic or basic is to test it with China rose indicator
and observe the change in colour which takes place
a If a drop of the given solution turns China rose indicator from light pink to magenta deep pink
then the given solution will be acidic in nature or it will be an acid see Figure 4 For example lemon

China rose
indicator
Light pink

Add acid
Magenta
Deep pink

Figure 4 Acids turn China rose indicator magenta deep pink
juice turns China rose indicator to magenta deep pink so lemon juice is acidic in nature That is lemon
juice contains an acid
b If a drop of the given solution turns China rose indicator from light pink to green then the given
solution will be basic in nature or it will be a base see Figure 5 For example baking soda solution turns

China rose
indicator
Light pink

Green
Add base

Figure 5 Bases turn China rose indicator green

China rose indicator to green therefore baking soda is a base
3 Turmeric as Indicator
Turmeric is another natural indicator Turmeric is a bright yellow powder obtained from a plant
Turmeric is called haldi in Hindi Turmeric contains a yellow dye Turmeric turns red in basic solution
Turmeric is used as indicator in the form of turmeric paper

ACTIVITY
Turmeric paper can be prepared as follows  Take a tablespoonful of turmeric powder add a little water
and make a paste Deposit the turmeric paste on a blotting paper or filter paper and dry it The yellow paper
thus obtained is the turmeric paper Cut thin strips of turmeric paper Use these strips of turmeric paper as
indicator
Turmeric paper is used as indicator Turmeric paper is yellow in colour
i Turmeric paper is yellow in acid solution
ii Bases turn the yellow turmeric paper to red
If a drop of the given solution turns the yellow turmeric paper to red then the given solution will be
basic in nature or it will be a base For example if a drop of baking soda solution is put on the strip of a
turmeric paper the yellow turmeric paper turns red This shows that baking soda solution is basic in
nature That is baking soda is a base The yellow turmeric paper however remains yellow on adding an
acid solution
We have just learnt that a base turns yellow turmeric paper to red Now if we put a drop of an acid
on this turmeric paper which has been turned red by a base then the turmeric paper will change from red
to yellow This is because acid cancels the effect of base and restores the original yellow colour of turmeric
paper
Many times we have noticed that a yellow stain of curry on a white shirt which is due to the presence
of turmeric in curry turns red when soap is scrubbed on it This is due to the fact that soap solution is basic
in nature which changes the colour of turmeric in the curry stain to red
4 Phenolphthalein Indicator
Phenolphthalein is a synthetic manmade acidbase indicator
i Phenolphthalein indicator is colourless in acid solution
ii Phenolphthalein indicator gives pink colour in basic solution
We will be using phenolphthalein indicator when we carry out the neutralisation reaction of an acid
and a base Please note that if we add acid in the solution of a base which has been turned pink by
phenolphthalein indicator then the solution will change from pink to colourless This is because acid
cancels the effect of base
There are some substances which have no effect on any indicator Such substances are neither acidic
nor basic The substances whose solutions do not change the colour of any indicator in any way are
called neutral substances For example the substances whose solutions do not change the colour of either
red litmus or blue litmus are known as neutral substances they are neither acidic nor basic Pure water
distilled water common salt and sugar are neutral substances So pure water common salt solution and
sugar solution do not change the colour of any indicator

ACIDS
If we cut a lemon neembu and taste it the lemon appears to have a
sour taste khatta taste see Figure 6 The sour taste of lemon is due to the
presence of an acid in it The acid present in lemon which gives it a sour
taste is called citric acid Raw mango raw grapes lemon juice orange juice
curd sour milk vinegar and tamarind imli etc are sour in taste due to
the presence of acids in them The acids present in plant materials and animals
are natural acids called organic acids The acids can be defined as follows
A substance which reacts with a base to form a salt and water is
called an acid Acids have sour taste Acids turn blue litmus to red Some Figure 6 Lemon tastes sour due
of the examples of acids are  Acetic acid Citric acid Hydrochloric acid to the presence of an acid in it
Sulphuric acid and Nitric acid Acids are of two types  Organic acids and
Mineral acids These are discussed below
Organic Acids
Organic acids are the naturally occurring acids They are found in various types of plants and
animals Some of the important organic acids which occur in nature are
1 Acetic acid
5 Tartaric acid
6 Ascorbic acid
2 Formic acid
3 Citric acid
7 Oxalic acid
4 Lactic acid
i Acetic acid is found in vinegar or sirka Vinegar is used as a preservative in foods

68
ii Formic acid is present in ants sting The sharp pain caused by the sting of an ant is due to the formic
acid pushed into our skin during the sting
iii Citric acid is present in citrus fruits such as lemons and oranges
iv Lactic acid is present in curd and in sour milk
v Tartaric acid is present in tamarind imli unripe grapes and unripe mangoes
vi Ascorbic acid is present in amla and citrus fruits such as lemons and oranges Ascorbic acid is
commonly known as vitamin C
vii Oxalic acid is present in spinach palak

ACTIVITY
We can test the presence of an acid in a substance by performing the litmus test For example we can
perform the litmus test to show the presence of acid in lemon juice or orange juice as follows
i Take some lemon juice in a testtube and add a little water to it
ii Put a drop of the lemon juice solution on a strip of red litmus paper with the help of a dropper We will
find that there is no change in the colour of red litmus paper This means that lemon juice is not basic
in nature because only basic substances or bases turn red litmus to blue
iii Now put a drop of lemon juice solution on a strip of blue litmus paper The blue litmus paper turns red
This shows that lemon juice is acidic in nature or lemon juice contains an acid This is because only
acidic substances or acids turn blue litmus to red
Organic acids or naturally occurring acids are weak acids It is not harmful to eat or drink
substances containing naturally occurring acids in them For example we can eat oranges or drink orange
juice which contain natural acids Similarly we can consume lemon juice because it contains organic acid
or natural acid which does not harm us
Mineral Acids
The acids prepared from the minerals of the earth are called mineral
acids Mineral acids are the manmade acids Mineral acids are also known
as laboratory acids because they are used in the science laboratory to
perform experiments see Figure 7 The three most common mineral acids
are
1 Hydrochloric acid
2 Sulphuric acid and
3 Nitric acid
We also use mineral acids in our daily life For example hydrochloric
Figure 7 These bottles contain
acid is used in cleaning kitchen sinks and bathroom sanitaryware like wash
mineral acids
basin and toilet seat Sulphuric acid is used in making storage batteries for
cars buses trucks and inverters Nitric acid is used by goldsmiths for cleaning gold and silver ornaments
Concentrated mineral acids are very dangerous These acids can burn our hands and clothes These
acids should be handled with great care In the laboratory acids are generally mixed with water to dilute
them Such acids are called dilute acids Dilute acids are less harmful to us
Strong Acids and Weak Acids
All the acids can be divided into two groups  strong acids and weak acids Hydrochloric acid
sulphuric acid and nitric acid are strong acids On the other hand acetic acid formic acid citric acid
tartaric acid and carbonic acid are some of the weak acids This can be written as follows

Strong acids
Hydrochloric acid
Sulphuric acid
Nitric acid

Weak acids
Acetic acid
Formic acid
Citric acid
Tartaric acid
Carbonic acid
It is obvious that the mineral acids are strong acids Only one mineral acid carbonic acid is a weak
acid Strong acids are very dangerous to drink Even the dilute solutions of strong acids are extremely
harmful to drink The organic acids are weak acids The dilute solutions of weak acids are quite safe to
drink Being weak the organic acids like acetic acid citric acid and tartaric acid are used as food
ingredients Many foods like pickle and tomato ketchup contain acetic acid in the form of vinegar Vinegar
preserves fruits and vegetables Baking powder used in making cakes and biscuits contains tartaric acid
Though carbonic acid is not an organic acid but it is a weak acid Carbonic acid is used in fizzy soft drinks
and soda water It gives them a pleasant taste
Acid Rain
The rain which contains a higher level of acid than normal is called acid rain Acid rain is caused
by the acidic gases like sulphur dioxide nitrogen dioxide and carbon dioxide which are released into the
air as pollutants during the burning of various types of fuels Sulphur dioxide gas dissolves in falling rain
drops to form sulphuric acid nitrogen dioxide gas dissolves in rain drops to form nitric acid whereas
carbon dioxide gas dissolves in rain drops to form carbonic acid The presence of sulphuric acid nitric acid
and carbonic acid in rain water makes the rain water acidic And when this acidic rain water falls on the
earth we call it acid rain Acid rain causes damage to aquatic animals like fish trees crop plants metal
structures and stone buildings and monuments This happens as follows
i Acid rain makes the water of lakes ponds and rivers too acidic due to which fish and other aquatic
animals get killed
ii Acid rain eats up the leaves of the trees gradually By losing leaves the trees die Acid rain also
damages crop plants in the fields
iii Acid rain damages the metal structures like steel bridges etc when it falls on them
iv Acid rain damages the surfaces of buildings and monuments made of stone
BASES
If we take some baking soda and taste it the baking soda appears to have a bitter taste kadwa taste
And if we rub a solution of baking soda between our fingers it feels soapy to touch or slippery to touch
The substances such as baking soda which are bitter in taste and feel soapy to touch are known as bases
Bases are the chemical opposites of acids When bases are added to acids they neutralise or cancel the
effect of acids We can now define bases as follows
A substance which can neutralise an acid to form a salt and water is called a base Bases have bitter
taste Bases turn red litmus to blue Some of the examples of bases are
1 Sodium hydroxide
5 Ammonium hydroxide
2 Potassium hydroxide
Ammonia solution
3 Calcium hydroxide
6 Sodium carbonate
4 Magnesium hydroxide
7 Sodium hydrogencarbonate
A base which is soluble in water is called an alkali All the bases which we have given above are
soluble in water so all of them are alkalis see Figure 8
70
i Sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are found in
soap
ii Calcium hydroxide is found in lime water
iii Magnesium hydroxide is found in milk of magnesia
iv Ammonium hydroxide also called ammonia solution is
found in window cleaners
v Sodium carbonate is found in washing soda
vi Sodium hydrogencarbonate is found in baking soda
Figure 8 These bottles contain laboratory
Strong Bases and Weak Bases
bases
Like acids bases can also be strong or weak Some of the
strong bases and weak bases are given below
Strong Bases
Weak Bases
Sodium hydroxide
Calcium hydroxide
Potassium hydroxide
Ammonium hydroxide
Sodium carbonate
Magnesium hydroxide
Sodium hydrogencarbonate
As we can see above sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are strong bases Sodium hydroxide
is commonly known as caustic soda and potassium hydroxide is commonly known as caustic potash
caustic means corrosive or burning Sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are dangerous bases
which can burn our skin They must be handled very carefully Calcium hydroxide ammonium hydroxide
and sodium carbonate are weak bases but their solutions are unsafe to drink Magnesium hydroxide is
however a very weak base which is safe to drink It is used in milk of magnesia and other indigestion
mixtures Similarly sodium hydrogencarbonate is a very weak base which is used as an antacid to cure
indigestion
We know that some of the sugary food eaten by us is converted into acid by the bacteria present in our
mouth And this acid causes tooth decay The toothpaste which we use for brushing and cleaning our teeth
is basic in nature Since toothpaste is basic it neutralises the acid in our mouth and hence prevents tooth
decay We will now give the main points of difference between acids and bases

Main Differences Between Acids and Bases
Acids

1 Acids have sour taste
2 Acids are not soapy to touch
3 Acids turn blue litmus to red

Bases
1 Bases have bitter taste
2 Bases feel soapy to touch
3 Bases turn red litmus to blue

Great care should be taken in handling laboratory acids and bases because they are corrosive in nature
irritating and harmful to skin
Neutral Substances
Those substances which are neither acidic nor basic in nature are called neutral substances Being
neither acidic nor basic neutral substances do not change the colour of any indicator Thus if the solution
of a substance in water does not change the colour of either blue litmus or red litmus then it will be a
neutral substance Some of the neutral substances are  Pure water or Distilled water Glucose
Canesugar and Common salt

71

ACTIVITY
We can confirm the neutral nature of substances by performing the litmus test For example let us put one
drop of distilled water on blue litmus paper and another drop of distilled water on red litmus paper We will
find that there is no change in the colour of blue litmus paper or red litmus paper This shows that distilled
water is neither acidic nor basic in nature So distilled water is neutral We can show the neutral nature of
glucose canesugar and common salt in a similar way by testing their water solutions aqueous solutions with
blue litmus paper and red litmus paper turn by turn
We will now answer some questions based on acids and bases
Sample Problem 1 You have been provided with three testtubes One of them contains distilled water
and the other two contain an acidic solution and a basic solution respectively If you are given only red
litmus paper how will you identify the contents of each testtube
Solution i Put the red litmus paper in all the testtubes turn by turn The solution which turns red
litmus to blue will be a basic solution The blue litmus paper formed here can now be used to test the acidic
solution
ii Put the blue litmus paper obtained above in the remaining two testtubes one by one The
solution which turns the blue litmus paper to red will be the acidic solution
iii The solution which has no effect on any litmus paper will be neutral and hence it will be distilled
water
Sample Problem 2 Three liquids are given to you One is hydrochloric acid another is sodium
hydroxide and the third is a sugar solution How will you identify them  You have only turmeric paper
indicator
Solution i Put one drop of each liquid on turmeric paper turn by turn The liquid which turns the
yellow turmeric paper red will be sodium hydroxide base The red turmeric paper formed here can now
be used to test hydrochloric acid
ii Put one drop each of the remaining two liquids on red turmeric paper The liquid which makes the
red turmeric paper yellow again will be hydrochloric acid This is because hydrochloric acid cancels
the effect of sodium hydroxide base on turmeric paper
iii The liquid which has no effect on the red turned turmeric paper will be sugar solution because it is

NEUTRALISATION

ACTIVITY
The acids and bases are chemically opposite substances So when an acid is mixed with a base they
neutralise or cancel the effect of each other The products formed on mixing an acid and a base are salt and
water The reaction in which an acid reacts with a base to form salt and water is called neutralisation A
neutralisation reaction can be represented as
Salt

Water
Acid

Base

Some heat is always evolved or produced in a neutralisation reaction This heat raises the
temperature of reaction mixture due to which the reaction mixture becomes hot
In a neutralisation reaction two new substances salt and water are formed The salt formed during a
neutralisation reaction depends on which acid and which base are reacted with each other An example
of neutralisation reaction is given below
Sodium hydroxide is a base and hydrochloric acid is an acid So when sodium hydroxide is treated
with hydrochloric acid then a neutralisation reaction takes place to form sodium chloride salt and
water This can be written as
Sodium chloride

Water
Sodium hydroxide
 Hydrochloric acid

NaOH
HCl
NaCl
H2O
The salt formed in this neutralisation reaction of sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid is sodium
chloride NaCl It is known as common salt Some heat is also evolved during this neutralisation reaction
This neutralisation reaction can be performed as follows

Dropper

We take 5 mL of dilute hydrochloric acid solution in a testtube The hydrochloric acid solution is
colourless Add 2 or 3 drops of phenolphthalein indicator to the acid in the testtube Shake the testtube
gently Phenolphthalein indicator is colourless There is no change in the colour of phenolphthalein indicator
on adding it to hydrochloric acid solution see Figure 9a

Figure 9 The process of neutralisation

Take sodium hydroxide solution base in a dropper Add this sodium hydroxide solution to hydrochloric
acid in the testtube drop wise stirring the testtube gently after each addition Continue to add sodium
hydroxide solution drop by drop while stirring till a light pink colour just appears in the solution in the testtube see Figure 9b We then stop adding more of sodium hydroxide solution
At this stage all the hydrochloric acid taken in the testtube has been completely neutralised by sodium
hydroxide base Thus a neutralisation reaction has taken place in the testtube The completion of
neutralisation reaction is indicated by the fact that when all the acid has been neutralised then a little excess
of the base changes the colour of phenolphthalein indicator to pink This makes the solution in the testtube
light pink
If we touch the testtube immediately after the neutralisation reaction is over we will find the testtube
to be somewhat hot This is because some heat is evolved during the neutralisation reaction This heat raises
the temperature of reaction mixture and makes the testtube feel hot

Neutralisation in Everyday Life
The neutralisation reactions involving acids and bases play a very important role in our everyday life
The remedy for indigestion caused by acidity treatment of an ants sting reducing the too acidic or too
basic nature of soil and the treatment of factory wastes all involve neutralisation reactions Let us discuss
this in detail
1 Indigestion
Our stomach produces hydrochloric acid This hydrochloric acid helps in
digesting our food without harming the stomach Sometimes excess of hydrochloric
acid is produced in the stomach due to various reasons one being overeating The
excess of acid in the stomach causes indigestion which produces pain and irritation
The person who has excess acid in the stomach is also said to suffer from acidity In
order to cure indigestion and get rid of pain we can take bases called antacids
antacid means antiacid Antacids are a group of mild bases which have no toxic
effects on the body Being basic in nature antacids react with excess acid in the
stomach and neutralise it This gives relief to the person concerned A common
antacid used for curing indigestion due to acidity is milk of magnesia see Figure
10 Milk of magnesia contains a base called magnesium hydroxide Magnesium
Figure 10 Milk of
hydroxide neutralises the excess acid present in the stomach and cures indigestion
magnesia is a medicine
Another antacid is baking soda Baking soda contains a base called sodium for
indigestion
hydrogencarbonate Antacids are available in the market in the form of liquid contains
magnesium
mixtures or tablets
hydroxide as antacid
2 Ants Sting
The sting of an ant contains an acid called formic acid So when an ant stings or bites a person it
injects an acidic liquid into the skin of the person which causes burning pain If an ant stings a person then
rubbing a mild base like baking soda solution or calamine solution on the stung area of the skin gives
relief This is because being a base baking soda solution or calamine solution neutralises the acidic liquid
injected by the ant and cancels its effect Please note that calamine solution contains a base called zinc
carbonate
3 Soil Treatment
The soil may be acidic or basic naturally The plants do not grow well if the soil at a place is too acidic
or too basic The excessive use of chemical fertilisers in the fields also makes the soil too acidic When the
soil is too acidic it is treated with bases such as quicklime calcium oxide or slaked lime calcium
hydroxide The bases such as quicklime or slaked lime neutralise the excess acid present in the soil and
reduce its acidic nature Thus a farmer should add quicklime or slaked lime in the fields if the soil is too
acidic Sometimes however the soil is too basic If the soil is too basic then decaying organic matter
called manure or compost is added to it The decaying organic matter releases acids which neutralise the
excess bases present in the soil and reduce its basic nature Thus a farmer should add decaying organic
matter manure or compost in his fields if the soil is too basic
4 Factory Wastes
The waste substances discharged by many factories contain acids If these untreated factory wastes are
discharged into water bodies like lakes ponds and rivers etc then the acids present in them will kill the
fish and other aquatic organisms which live in the water bodies The acidic factory wastes should be
treated with basic substances to neutralise them before discharging them into water bodies such as
lakes ponds and rivers etc

A salt is a substance formed by the reaction of an acid with a base An example of salt is sodium
chloride It is formed by the reaction of hydrochloric acid with sodium hydroxide base In a way we can
say that a salt has two parents  an acid and a base So the name of a salt consists of two parts  the first part of
the salts name is derived from the name of the base and the second part of the salts name is derived from
the name of the acid For example the name of the salt called sodium chloride comes from the sodium
hydroxide base and hydrochloric acid Please note that
i The salts of hydrochloric acid are called chlorides
ii The salts of sulphuric acid are called sulphates
iii The salts of nitric acid are called nitrates
iv The salts of carbonic acid are called carbonates
v The salts of acetic acid are called acetates and so on

Salts can be of three types  i Neutral salts ii Acidic salts and iii Basic salts
Those salts which form a neutral solution on dissolving in water are called neutral salts The salts
formed by the neutralisation of a strong acid by a strong base are neutral salts The two examples of neutral
salts are sodium chloride NaCl and sodium sulphate Na2SO4 The solution of a neutral salt has no
effect on any litmus For example a solution of sodium chloride salt in water does not change the colour
of any litmus paper
Those salts which form an acidic solution on dissolving in water are called acidic salts The salts
formed by the neutralisation of a strong acid with a weak base are acidic salts The two examples of acidic salts
are ammonium chloride NH4Cl and ammonium sulphate NH42SO4 The solution of an acidic salt in
water turns blue litmus to red For example the solution of ammonium chloride salt in water turns blue
litmus paper to red
Those salts which form basic solutions on dissolving in water are called basic salts The salts formed
by the neutralisation of weak acids with strong bases are basic salts The two examples of basic salts are
sodium carbonate Na2CO3 and sodium hydrogencarbonate NaHCO3 The solutions of basic salts in
water turn red litmus to blue For example the solution of sodium carbonate in water turns red litmus
paper to blue We are now in a position to answer the following questions

Physical and Chemical
Changes

e have many substances around us All these substances have certain properties such as state
solid liquid or gas size shape colour smell temperature composition and structure etc When
one or more properties of a substance become different we say that a change has taken place in
it Here is an example We know that ice melts to form water Melting of ice is a common change around us
Now ice is a solid whereas water is a liquid So the melting of ice involves a change in state  from solid state to
liquid state Changes are taking place all around us Some of the changes observed by us in our everyday life
are
i Formation of curd from milk
iv Drying of clothes
ii Cooking of food
v Ripening of fruits and
iii Burning of fuels
vi Rusting of iron
Some changes are beneficial to us whereas some are harmful to us For example ripening of fruits is a
beneficial change So we try to make the ripening of fruits faster by artificial methods On the other hand
rusting of iron is a harmful change So we try to prevent rusting of iron objects by various methods such
as painting the iron object etc The change in a substance does not occur on its own There is always a
cause which brings about a change in a substance For example ice does not melt on its own to form
water Ice must be given some heat to melt and change into water Thus heat is the cause of the change
of state of ice from solid to liquid
Types of Changes
Changes can be of two types
1 Physical changes and
2 Chemical changes
We will now discuss physical changes and chemical changes in detail one by one Let us start with the
physical changes
79

80

PHYSICAL CHANGES

Those changes in which no new substances are formed are called physical changes The changes in
state size shape and colour of a substance are physical changes The properties such as state size shape
and colour of a substance are called its physical properties So we can also say that  Those changes in
which a substance undergoes a change in its physical properties are called physical changes The physical
changes are temporary changes which can be easily reversed to form the original substance Very little
energy in the form of heat etc is either absorbed or evolved in physical changes Thus the important
characteristics of a physical change are as follows
i No new substance is formed in a physical change
ii A physical change is a temporary change A physical change can be easily reversed
iii Very little energy heat etc is either absorbed or evolved in a physical change
iv A temporary change in colour may take place in a physical change
We will now take an example to understand a physical change clearly Let us take a sheet of paper and
cut it into a number of pieces Now we cannot join the cut pieces of paper to make the original sheet of
paper But each small piece of paper is still paper it has not changed into something else So during the
cutting of a sheet of paper into pieces of paper only the size and shape of paper has changed but no new
substance has been formed So the cutting of paper or tearing of paper is a physical change
Some more examples of physical changes are  Melting of ice to form water  Freezing of water to
form ice  Boiling of water to form steam  Condensation of steam to form water  Evaporation of water
to form water vapour  Condensation of water vapour to form liquid water Cutting of cloth  Breaking
of a chalk stick  Conversion of chalk stick into chalk dust  Breaking of a glass tumbler  Breaking of a
wooden stick  Cutting of a log of wood into pieces of wood  Melting of wax  Formation of clouds
Drying of wet clothes  Dissolving salt in water to make salt solution  Dissolving sugar in water to make
sugar solution  Making soda water by dissolving carbon dioxide  Glowing of an electric bulb or tubelight  Stretching of a rubber band  Grinding of a substance  Hammering of metals to form thin sheets like
beating aluminium metal to form aluminium foil  Stretching metals to form wires  and Conversion of
liquefied petroleum gas LPG from liquid form in cylinder to gaseous form when it comes out of cylinder
into gas stove We will now describe some of these physical changes in detail

Melting of Ice and Freezing of Water
Take some ice in a beaker and keep it aside for some time We will see that ice melts to form water see
Figure 1 Actually the ice kept in beaker receives heat from the surrounding air to melt and form water
Though ice and water look different they are both made
of water molecules This means that no new substance is
formed during the melting of ice only a change of state
from solid to liquid takes place during the melting of
Water
liquid
ice So the melting of ice to form water is a physical solid
change The change which occurs during the melting of
ice to form water can be reversed easily by freezing the
water to form ice again This can be done as follows
Figure 1 The melting of ice to form water is a
Let us keep the beaker containing water in the freezer
physical change
compartment of a refrigerator After a few hours the
water kept in the freezer of a refrigerator gets cooled too much freezes or solidifies to form ice In this
case the liquid water changes into solid water called ice Only a change in state from liquid to solid takes
place during the freezing of water to form ice but no new substance is formed So the freezing of water
to form ice is a physical change

81

Boiling of Water and Condensation of Steam
Take some water in a hard glass beaker and heat it by using a burner till
it starts boiling When the water starts boiling we can see the steam rising
Steam
from the surface of hot water see Figure 2 Now water is a liquid whereas
gas
steam is a gas So during the boiling of water only a change in state from
liquid to gas has taken place Though water and steam look different they
are both made of water molecules This means that no new substance is
formed during the boiling of water So the boiling of water to form steam
Water
is a physical change The change which occurs during the boiling of water to
liquid
form steam can be reversed easily by condensing the steam to form water
again This can be done as follows
Hold an inverted frying pan by its handle over the rising steam at some
distance above the beaker of boiling water Now if we look at the inner Figure 2 The boiling of water to
surface of the frying pan we will see drops of water sticking to it Actually form steam is a physical change
when hot rising steam comes in contact with the inverted frying pan then
some of the steam gets cooled and condenses to form drops of liquid water During the condensation of
steam there is only a change in state from gaseous state to liquid state but no new substance is formed So
the condensation of steam to form water is a physical change
Steam is very hot water vapour So we can also say that the conversion of water into water vapour is
a physical change In other words evaporation of water is a physical change The conversion of water
vapour into liquid water on cooling is also a physical change In other words condensation of water
vapour is a physical change

The Case of Chalk Stick and Chalk Dust
Let us take a chalk stick and go on writing on the blackboard Soon the whole chalk stick will be
converted into small chalk particles called chalk dust The conversion of chalk stick into chalk dust is a
physical change because both the chalk stick and the chalk dust are just the same substance only their size
is different No new substance is formed during the conversion of chalk stick into chalk dust The change
which occurs during the conversion of chalk stick into chalk dust can be reversed easily as follows
We take the chalk dust or chalk powder and add a little water to it to make a thick paste of chalk dust
This thick paste of chalk dust can be moulded into a chalk stick and then dried In this way we can get back
the original chalk stick from the chalk dust Thus the physical change from chalk stick to chalk dust is a
temporary change It can be easily reversed by converting chalk dust back into chalk stick

Making of a Solution
We take some water in a porcelain dish and dissolve some common salt in it The salt disappears in
water and forms a salt solution So a change has taken place in making salt solution Let us now heat this
porcelain dish containing salt solution on a burner till all the water evaporates A white powder is left
behind in the porcelain dish If we taste this white powder we will find that it is common salt It is the same
common salt which we had dissolved in water earlier This means that no new chemical substance has been
formed by dissolving common salt in water to make salt solution So the dissolving of salt in water to
make salt solution is a physical change Similarly dissolving sugar in water to make sugar solution is also a
physical change
Breaking of a Glass Tumbler
When a glass tumbler breaks it forms many pieces Each broken piece of glass tumbler is still glass So
during the breaking of a glass tumbler only the size and shape of glass has changed but no new substance
has been formed So the breaking of a glass tumbler is a physical change

82
Heating a Hacksaw Blade
Hacksaw blade is a long toothed blade which is used to cut metal objects Take a used hacksaw blade
and hold its one end with a pair of tongs Keep the other end of hacksaw blade over the flame of a gas
burner to heat it After some time we will see that the tip of hacksaw blade gets heated too much and turns
red in colour it is said to become redhot Now remove the tip of hacksaw blade from the burner and
allow it to cool On cooling the tip of hacksaw blade gets back to its original grey colour Now only a
temporary change in colour of hacksaw blade takes place during heating no new substance is formed in
this process So the heating of hacksaw blade to the redhot stage is a physical change which can be
easily reversed on cooling Caution  Heating the tip of hacksaw blade to redhot stage is a very
dangerous activity It should be demonstrated only by the teachers

CHEMICAL CHANGES

Those changes in which new substances are formed are called chemical changes The properties of
new substances formed in chemical changes are entirely different from those of the original substances
During chemical change a substance undergoes a change in its chemical composition or change in
chemical properties Chemical changes are also called chemical reactions The chemical changes are
permanent changes which can usually not be reversed to form the original substance A lot of energy in
the form of heat light sound etc is either absorbed or given out in chemical changes Thus the various
characteristics of a chemical change are as follows
i One or more new substances are formed in a chemical change
ii A chemical change is a permanent change A chemical change usually cannot be reversed
iii A lot of energy in the form of heat light etc is either absorbed or given out in a chemical change
iv Sound may be produced in a chemical change
v A change in smell may take place or a new smell may be given off in a chemical change
vi A permanent change in colour may take place in a chemical change
vii A gas may be formed in a chemical change
Let us take an example to understand a chemical change clearly If we
burn a piece of paper with a lighted match stick then entirely new
substances such as carbon dioxide water vapour smoke and ash are
produced So the burning of paper is a chemical change see Figure 3
Heat and light are also given out during the burning of paper The burning
of paper is a permanent change which cannot be reversed For example
we cannot combine the products of burning of paper to form the original
paper again In fact the burning of any substance is a chemical change
Burning is always accompanied by the production of heat Some light is
also produced during burning
Some more examples of chemical changes are  Souring of milk
Formation of curd from milk  Cooking of food like rice and chapatis  Figure 3 The burning of paper is
Spoilage of food  Change in colour of cut apple cut brinjal or cut potato
a chemical change
on keeping in air  Photosynthesis  Digestion of food  Neutralisation
reaction  Explosion of a firework or cracker  Burning of magnesium ribbon Burning of fuels like
burning of wood coal kerosene LPG and biogas  Burning of dry leaves  Burning of candle wax  Burning
of incense stick agarbatti  Rusting of iron  Ripening of fruits  Reaction between vinegar and baking soda
which produces carbon dioxide gas  Passing carbon dioxide gas through lime water which produces
calcium carbonate precipitate  Reaction between copper sulphate solution and iron to form iron sulphate
and copper  Formation of manure or compost from leaves  Formation of biogas from animal wastes
like cowdung All these changes are chemical changes because new substances are formed in them
Moreover these changes cannot be reversed We will discuss some of these changes in a little more detail

When food gets spoiled it produces a foul smell This shows that new substances have been formed
in the spoiled food which have foul smell So the spoilage of food is a chemical change If we cut an apple
into slices and keep it aside for some time we will find that the cut surface of apple acquires a brown
colour The cut surface of an apple slice acquires a brown colour due to the formation of new substances
by the action of oxygen of air So the change in colour of a cut apple slice on keeping in air is due to a
chemical change Similarly the cut surface of a brinjal or potato turns black on keeping in air for
sometime due to chemical change This is because new substances are formed which impart black colour
to their cut surfaces
During photosynthesis the plants combine carbon dioxide and water in the presence of chlorophyll
and sunlight to form two new substances  glucose food and oxygen gas So photosynthesis is a chemical
change In the process of digestion the various food materials break down to form new substances which
can be absorbed by the body So the process of digestion is a chemical change When an acid reacts with
a base then a neutralisation reaction takes place in which two new substances salt and water are formed
So neutralisation is a chemical change The explosion of a firework like a cracker is a chemical change
because many new susbstances are formed in this process The explosion of a firework also produces heat
light sound and unpleasant gases These unpleasant gases pollute the air around us
In a biogas plant anaerobic bacteria digest break down the animal wastes like cowdung and
produce biogas whose major component is methane gas The formation of biogas from animal wastes is
a chemical change This is because new substances like methane are produced from animal waste Biogas
is burnt as a fuel The burning of biogas is also a chemical change This is because burning of biogas
produces new substances like carbon dioxide and water vapour alongwith the evolution of heat and some
light Similarly the burning of liquefied petroleum gas LPG in a gas stove is also a chemical change

We will now study some of the chemical changes by performing activities
1 Burning of Magnesium Ribbon
Magnesium is a metal which burns easily on heating A long and thin strip of
magnesium metal is called magnesium ribbon We usually use magnesium metal
in the form of a magnesium ribbon to perform activities
When a magnesium ribbon is heated it burns in air with a brilliant white light
to form a powdery ash called magnesium oxide This magnesium oxide is an
entirely new substance Thus a new substance is formed during the burning of
magnesium ribbon So the burning of magnesium ribbon is a chemical change
see Figure 4 We can perform the magnesium ribbon burning activity as follows

Figure 4 The burning of
magnesium ribbon is a
chemical change

84

ACTIVITY

Take a small piece of magnesium ribbon and clean it by rubbing its surface with a sand paper Hold the
magnesium ribbon at one end with a pair of tongs and bring its other end over the flame of a burner see
Figure 5a The magnesium ribbon starts burning with a dazzling white light Hold the burning magnesium
ribbon over a watch glass so that the powdery ash being formed by the burning of magnesium collects in the
watch glass see Figure 5b Actually when magnesium ribbon burns in air then the magnesium metal

b Magnesium ribbon burns in air
to form magnesium oxide
Figure 5

a Magnesium ribbon being
heated over a burner

combines with the oxygen of air to form a new substance called magnesium oxide This change can be
written in the form of a word equation as follows
Magnesium
 Oxygen
Magnesium oxide

Mg
O2
MgO
It is the magnesium oxide compound which appears as a white powdery ash So magnesium oxide ash
is the new substance formed when magnesium burns in air The burning of magnesium ribbon is a chemical
change because a new substance magnesium oxide is formed during this change

We can carry out another chemical change by using the magnesium oxide ash formed by the
burning of magnesium ribbon This can be done as follows

ACTIVITY

Take magnesium oxide ash in a hard glass testtube and add a small amount of water to it Stir the
magnesium oxide and water mixture carefully with a glass rod to obtain an aqueous solution of magnesium
oxide Test the magnesium oxide solution with blue litmus paper and red litmus paper respectively as
follows
i Take a strip of blue litmus paper and put a drop of magnesium oxide solution on it The blue colour
of litmus paper does not turn to red showing that magnesium oxide solution is not acidic
ii Now take a strip of red litmus paper and put a drop of magnesium oxide solution on it The red litmus
paper turns blue showing that magnesium oxide solution is basic in nature
Actually when we dissolve magnesium oxide in water then magnesium oxide combines with water to
form a new substance called magnesium hydroxide This change can be written in the form of a word
equation as follows
Magnesium oxide

Water
Magnesium hydroxide

MgO
H2O
MgOH2
The new substance magnesium hydroxide formed during this change is a base which turns red litmus
paper to blue The dissolving of magnesium oxide in water is a chemical change because a new substance
magnesium hydroxide is produced during this change

85
2 Reaction Between Baking Soda and Vinegar
When baking soda and vinegar are mixed together then bubbles of carbon
dioxide gas are formed alongwith some other substances This carbon dioxide is an
entirely new substance The reaction between baking soda and vinegar is a
chemical change because it forms carbon dioxide as one of the new substances We
can carry out the chemical change between baking soda and vinegar as follows
Take about 10 mL vinegar in a testtube and add a pinch of baking soda to it We
will hear a hissing sound and see the bubbles of carbon dioxide gas coming out and
rising in the testtube see Figure 6

Sodium hydrogencarbonate

Acetic acid

Sodium acetate  Carbon dioxide  Water

Vinegar

Baking soda

Baking soda is sodium hydrogencarbonate and vinegar contains acetic acid So
when baking soda and vinegar are mixed together then a chemical change takes
Figure 6 Chemical reacplace between sodium hydrogencarbonate and acetic acid to form three new
tion between baking soda
substances  sodium acetate carbon dioxide and water This chemical change can be and vinegar
written in the form of a word equation as follows

We can carry out another chemical change by using the
carbon dioxide gas produced in the above chemical reaction
between baking soda and vinegar This can be done as
follows
Prepare carbon dioxide gas by adding baking soda to
vinegar in a testtube Take some freshly prepared lime water
in another testtube Pass carbon dioxide gas through lime
water by using a glass delivery tube as shown in Figure 7 We
will see that lime water turns milky This happens as follows
Lime water is calcium hydroxide solution When carbon
dioxide gas is passed through lime water then calcium
hydroxide combines with carbon dioxide to form a white solid
substance calcium carbonate which makes lime water
appear milky This chemical change can be written in the
Figure 7 Passing carbon dioxide gas through
lime water
form of a word equation as follows
 Calcium carbonate
Calcium hydroxide
 Carbon dioxide

Water
CaOH2
CO2
CaCO3
H2O
Lime water

Makes lime water
look milky

The reaction between lime water and carbon dioxide gas is a chemical change because a new
substance calcium carbonate is formed during this change The turning of lime water milky is used as a
standard test for carbon dioxide gas This is because only carbon dioxide gas can turn lime water milky by
forming a white precipitate of calcium carbonate No other gas can turn lime water milky
Note  To prepare lime water dissolve some lime choona in water in a bottle Stir the solution and keep
it for some time Pour a little clear solution from the top This is lime water
3 Reaction Between Copper Sulphate Solution and Iron
When an iron object like an iron nail etc is kept immersed in the blue coloured solution of copper
sulphate then a chemical change takes place to form green coloured iron sulphate solution and a brown
deposit of copper on the iron object like nail This change can be written in the form of a word equation
as follows

86
Copper sulphate solution

Iron

Iron sulphate solution

The reaction between copper sulphate CuSO4 solution and iron Fe is a chemical change because
it produces two new substances  iron sulphate FeSO4 solution and copper Cu We can perform the
reaction between copper sulphate solution and an iron nail as follows Please note that the common name
of copper sulphate is blue vitriol It is called neela thotha in Hindi

ACTIVITY

Dissolve a little of copper sulphate in half testtube of water Add a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid to
obtain a clear solution This will give us a bluecoloured copper sulphate solution Take a big iron nail and
place it carefully in the testtube containing copper sulphate solution see Figure 8a Keep the testtube

a
b
Figure 8 Chemical reaction between copper sulphate solution and iron nail

containing copper sulphate solution and iron nail aside for a few hours We will see that the blue colour of
copper sulphate solution fades gradually and ultimately changes to light green colour and a brown deposit or
layer is formed on the iron nail see Figure 8b We can take out the iron nail from the testtube to see the
brown deposit on it clearly These changes are due to a chemical reaction between copper sulphate solution
and iron nail which produces two new substances  iron sulphate and copper The formation of green coloured
substance iron sulphate makes the solution green And the formation of copper metal deposits a brown layer
on the iron nail

Importance of Chemical Changes
Chemical changes are very important in our lives All the new substances which we use in various
fields of our life are produced as a result of chemical changes or chemical reactions Some of the examples
of the importance of chemical changes are given below
i Metals are extracted from their naturally occurring compounds called ores by a series of chemical
changes For example iron metal is extracted from the iron ore by chemical changes
ii Medicines are prepared by carrying out a chain of chemical changes
iii The materials such as plastics soaps detergents perfumes acids bases salts etc are all made by
carrying out various types of chemical changes
iv Every new material is discovered by studying different types of chemical changes
Differences Between Physical and Chemical Changes
The main differences between physical and chemical changes are given below
Physical change
1 No new substance is formed in a physical change
2 A physical change is a temporary change
3 A physical change is easily reversible
4 Very little energy in the form of heat
etc is absorbed or given out in a
physical change

Chemical change
1 A new substance is formed in a chemical change
2 A chemical change is a permanent change
3 A chemical change is usually irreversible
4 A lot of energy in the form of heat light
sound etc is absorbed or given out in a chemical
change

87
Please note that the same substance can undergo a physical change or a chemical change depending
upon the conditions For example
i The tearing of a sheet of paper into pieces of paper is a physical change but the burning of a sheet of
paper is a chemical change
ii The melting of wax is a physical change but the burning of wax is a chemical change So when a
candle burns then both physical and chemical changes take place This is because when a candle
burns then some of the wax melts physical change and some of the wax burns chemical change

A Protective Shield of Ozone
Ozone is a gas There is a layer of ozone gas high up in the atmosphere The ozone layer in the upper
atmosphere is very useful The ozone layer protects us from the harmful ultraviolet radiations which
come from the sun This happens as follows  Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiations coming from the sun
and breaks down to form oxygen In this way ozone layer absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiations coming
from the sun and prevents them from reaching the earth The breaking down of ozone into oxygen is a
chemical change If ultraviolet radiations were not absorbed by ozone layer they would reach the earths
surface and cause harm to us and other living things Ultraviolet radiations can cause skin cancer damage
our eyes and plants including crops The ozone layer in the atmosphere acts as a natural protective shield
against the harmful ultraviolet radiations coming from the sun

RUSTING OF IRON

Rust

When an iron object is left in damp air or water for a considerable time it gets covered with a redbrown flaky substance called rust This is called rusting of iron During the rusting of iron iron metal
combines with the oxygen of air in the presence of water moisture to form a compound iron oxide This
iron oxide is rust The process of rusting can be represented by the following word equation
Iron

Oxygen

Water
Iron oxide

H2O
Fe2O3
Fe
O2
From damp air

Rust is iron oxide Fe2O3 Thus rust and iron are not the same
substance Rust is different from iron on which it gets deposited Rusting of
iron is a chemical change because a new substance iron oxide is formed
in this process
Almost every iron or steel object kept in the open gets rusted slowly
We can usually see the rusted iron gates of parks and iron benches kept in
the gardens which always remain in the open see Figure 9 The agricultural
tools such as spades and shovels also get rusted when exposed to the
atmosphere for a considerable time In the kitchen the iron pan tawa often
gets rusted if kept in wet state for some time We can also usually see the
formation of some rust on iron grills iron railings iron pipes iron nails old
cars bicycles and steel bridges etc
Conditions Necessary for Rusting
Both oxygen and water or moisture must be present for the rusting of
iron to occur So two conditions are necessary for the rusting of iron to take
place
i presence of oxygen of air and
ii presence of water or water vapour called moisture

Figure 9 This picture shows a
part of the rusted iron gate

88
Iron rusts when placed in damp air or moist air or when placed in water Now damp air or moist
air also contains water vapour Thus damp air alone provides both the things oxygen and water required
for the rusting of iron to occur Again ordinary water always has some dissolved oxygen in it So ordinary
water also supplies both the things oxygen and water needed for the rusting of iron
i If the air at a place has a high moisture content more water vapour that is if the air at a place is
more humid then the rusting of iron becomes faster The rusting of iron is faster in coastal areas seaside
areas because the air at those places contains more water vapour or more moisture
ii The presence of salt in water makes the process of rusting of iron faster Thus an iron object will rust
much faster when kept in seawater which is salty water than when kept in fresh water having no salts
dissolved in it

Rusting Damages Iron Objects
Rust is soft and porous and it gradually falls off from the surface of a rusted iron object and then the
iron below starts rusting Thus rusting of iron is a continuous process which slowly eats up the iron
objects and makes them useless Since iron is used in making a large number of objects or articles such as
bridges grills railings gates and bodies of cars buses trucks and ships etc rusting of iron causes a great
loss over a period of time It is obvious that we should have some ways of preventing the rusting of iron

How Do We Prevent Rusting of Iron
Rusting takes place when an iron object comes in contact with air containing oxygen and water So if
air and water are prevented from coming in contact with iron objects then rusting will not take place Thus
most of the methods of preventing rusting of iron involve coating the iron object with something to keep
out air and water which cause rusting Some of the methods of preventing rusting of iron are given
below
i Rusting of iron can be prevented by painting When a coat of paint is applied to the surface of an
iron object then air and moisture cannot come in contact with the iron object and hence no rusting takes
place The window grills railings steel furniture iron bridges railway coaches and bodies of cars buses
and trucks etc are all painted regularly to protect them from rusting
ii Rusting of iron can be prevented by applying grease or oil When some grease or oil is applied to
the surface of an iron object then air and moisture cannot come in contact with it and hence rusting is
prevented For example the tools and machine parts made of iron and steel are smeared with grease or oil
to prevent their rusting
iii Rusting of iron can be prevented by galvanisation The process of
depositing a thin layer or coating of zinc metal on iron objects is called
galvanisation Galvanisation is done by dipping an iron object in molten
zinc metal A thin layer of zinc metal formed on the surface of an iron object
protects it from rusting because zinc metal remains unaffected by air and
moisture The iron sheets used for making buckets drums dustbins and
sheds roofs are galvanised to prevent their rusting see Figure 10 The iron
pipes used in our homes to carry water are also galvanised to prevent
rusting
iv Iron is coated with chromium to prevent rusting This is called
chromeplating Chromium metal is resistant to the action of air and
moisture So when a layer of chromium is deposited on an iron object then Figure 10 This bucket is made
the iron object is protected from rusting Chromiumplating is done on steel
of galvanised iron sheet to
furniture taps bicycle handle bars and car bumpers etc made of iron and
prevent its rusting
steel to prevent them from rusting
v Rusting of iron can be prevented by alloying it to make stainless steel When iron is mixed or
alloyed with carbon chromium and nickel then stainless steel is obtained Stainless steel is an alloy of iron

89
Stainless steel does not rust at all Cooking utensils knives scissors and surgical instruments are made of
stainless steel and do not rust at all

Figure 11 The iron pillar at Delhi

The Iron Pillar at Delhi
There is an iron pillar near the Qutub Minar in Delhi which is more
than 7 metres high and weighs more than 6000 kg see Figure 11 It was
built more than 1600 years ago Even after such a long period the iron
pillar has not rusted at all This shows that Indian scientists had made
great advances in metal making technology as back as 1600 years which
enabled them to make this iron pillar having the quality of great rust
resistance

The Case of Ships
Ships are made of iron and steel and a part of the ship always
remains under seawater Even on the part of ships which remain above
seawater water drops keep clinging to their outer surface Moreover
the seawater contains many salts The presence of salts in seawater makes
the process of rust formation on ships faster So inspite of being painted
regularly the ships suffer a lot of damage from rusting In fact the
damage caused by rusting is so much that a fraction of ships iron has to
be replaced every year This causes a lot of monetary loss money loss to
the world

CRYSTALLISATION

Seawater contains salts dissolved in it which make it salty We have learnt in Class VI that salt can
be separated from seawater by the process of evaporation The process of evaporation to dryness is not
a good technique of separation because
i The soluble impurities do not get removed in the process of evaporation of a salt solution So the salt
obtained by evaporation is not pure
ii The crystals of salts obtained by the process of evaporation are small And the shape of crystals
cannot be seen clearly
Large crystals of pure substances can however be obtained from their solutions by the process of
crystallisation So the solid substances are usually purified by the process of crystallisation Crystallisation
is an example of a physical change This is described below
The solid particles having flat surfaces straight edges and regular shapes are called crystals Many
substances form crystals The process of cooling a hot concentrated solution of a substance to obtain
crystals is called crystallisation The process of crystallisation is used to obtain large crystals of a pure solid
substance from the impure solid substance An impure solid substance usually contains two types of
impurities  insoluble impurities and soluble impurities The insoluble impurities are removed by filtering its
solution whereas soluble impurities get removed during crystallisation As an example we will now
describe how large crystals of pure copper sulphate can be obtained from an impure sample of copper
sulphate powder by the process of crystallisation

ACTIVITY TO OBTAIN PURE COPPER SULPHATE CRYSTALS
FROM AN IMPURE SAMPLE
Impure copper sulphate powder can be purified by the process of crystallisation to obtain large crystals
of pure copper sulphate This is done as follows  Take about 100 mL of water in a beaker and add a few
drops of dilute sulphuric acid to it Heat the water over a burner till it boils Add copper sulphate powder
slowly to the hot water with constant stirring see Figure 12a Continue to add copper sulphate till no

Figure 12 Making crystals of copper sulphate

more copper sulphate can be dissolved This will give us a saturated solution of copper sulphate Filter the
hot saturated solution of copper sulphate to remove insoluble impurities Allow the hot and concentrated
solution of copper sulphate to cool slowly Do not disturb the solution when it is cooling After some time
we will see large copper sulphate crystals at the bottom of the beaker see Figure 12b Separate the copper
sulphate crystals from solution by filtration and dry The soluble impurities present in copper sulphate do not
crystallise and hence remain behind in the solution

The crystals of other substances like alum phitkari can also be prepared in a similar way Impure
common salt obtained by the evaporation of seawater is also purified by the process of crystallisation We

Weather Climate and
Adaptations of Animals to
Climate

uring the summer days we wear light coloured clothes because the weather is hot In winter we
prefer to wear dark coloured clothes because the weather is cold And if there are clouds in the sky
on a particular day we usually take an umbrella or raincoat with us because the weather is
cloudy and it may rain any time If there is going to be a religious function or a wedding in our family then
our elders discuss the weather which is likely to be at that point of time and plan accordingly by putting
up tents only or making a waterproof pandal Many times we have heard the experts discussing weather
on radio or television before the start of a game such as a cricket match This is because say a cloudy
weather can change the course of a cricket match or spoil it altogether by bringing showers of rain Thus
weather has a great effect on our lives In fact many of our activities are planned by taking into account the
weather predicted for that day It is for this reason that there are daily reports of impending weather
coming weather in newspapers radio and television
If however we are planning to go to a hill station for holidays then we always take along woollen
clothes with us because the climate on the hill stations is always cold On the other hand if we are going to
a coastal area seaside area then we do not need woollen clothes because the climate there is not cold As
we will study after a while weather and climate are two different things In this Chapter we will first
discuss weather and climate and then describe how different types of animals are adapted to the climates
of their habitats Before we do that we should know the meaning of the terms humidityand rain gauge
These are discussed below
We know that air or atmosphere always contains some water vapour or moisture in it Humidity is
a measure of water vapour or moisture in air When the amount of water vapour in the air is high we
say humidity is high and the air feels moist or damp Under these conditions the sweat pasina from our
94

95
body does not evaporate readily and we feel hot and uncomfortable If the humidity in an area is generally
high the climate there is said to be humid On the other hand if the amount of water vapour in the air is
low we say the humidity is low When the humidity is low the air feels dry Under these conditions the
sweat from our body evaporates readily and we feel cool and comfortable
Humidity of air is expressed as a percentage  A humidity of 100 per cent 100 at a particular
temperature means that the air is saturated with water vapour at that temperature which means the air is
holding the maximum amount of water vapour for that temperature A humidity of 50 per cent 50
means that the air contains half the amount of water vapour required for saturation at that temperature
Rainfall is measured by an instrument called rain gauge Rain gauge is basically a measuring cylinder
with a funnel at the top to collect rainwater Rain gauge measures the rainfall at a place in the unit of
millimetres mm

WEATHER

If the temperature of air or atmosphere around us on a particular day is high we say that the weather
is hot today If the temperature on a day is low we say that the weather is cold If there is lot of water
vapour or moisture in the air we say that the weather is too humid If
there is rain we say the weather is rainy today see Figure 1 And if a lot
of wind starts blowing on a day then we say that the weather is very
windy today So when we talk of weather we are actually describing the
condition of the atmosphere or air around us at a particular time We can
now define weather as follows  The daytoday condition of the
atmosphere at a place and time with respect to the temperature pressure
humidity wind speed and wind direction sunshine clouds rainfall or
snowfall etc is called weather at that place at that time The various
factors which decide weather at a place are called elements of weather
The major elements of weather at a place are temperature pressure humidity
wind speed and wind direction sunshine clouds and rainfall or snowfall
Weather is called mausam in Hindi
There are many different types of weather Some types of weather are
hot cold sunny cloudy foggy dry humid windy and rainy The weather
at a place is generally not the same on any two days The weather at a place Figure 1 We take out umbrellas
changes day after day and week after week Actually weather is such a
during rainy weather
complex phenomenon that it can change even over very short periods of
time For example it can be sunny weather in the morning but suddenly clouds may appear from nowhere
and it can become cloudy And if it starts raining then it becomes rainy weather It is also possible that a
heavy rain may vanish in a matter of minutes and give way to bright
sunshine Weather is never constant anywhere So it is not easy to
predict weather The weather plays a big part in our lives today Weather
affects many of the things we do For example we wear the clothes
according to the prevailing weather  we eat food depending on weather
and we make our travel plans keeping the weather in mind We will now
discuss the source of weather and why weather changes so frequently
What Produces Weather
Weather is produced by the heat of the sun and the effect it has on
the atmosphere This happens as follows  The sun is a huge sphere of
hot gases at a very high temperature Though the distance of the sun
from the earth is very large even then it is the source of all heat and light
on the earth see Figure 2 The heat energy of the sun absorbed and
reflected by the earths surface oceans and atmosphere plays an

Figure 2 The sun is the primary
source of energy that produces
weather and causes changes in the
weather

96
important role in determining the weather at any place For example the suns heat causes water from the
oceans and land to evaporate These water vapour rise high up in the atmosphere get cooled condense and
form clouds in the atmosphere which produce rain leading to rainy weather Similarly heat from the sun
heats the earths surface The hot surface of earth heats the air near it This hot air being lighter rises up
creating an area of low pressure Air from high pressure area moves towards the low pressure area The air
moving from high pressure area to low pressure area is called wind So it is the suns heat which causes
wind to blow and gives us windy weather
From the above discussion we conclude that the rainy weather and windy weather are produced by
the sun In fact all types of weather and all changes in weather are caused by the sun Thus the sun is
the primary source of energy which causes changes in the weather The weather changes so frequently
because the condition of the earths atmosphere keeps changing frequently due to the various effects
produced by the suns heat

Maximum and Minimum Temperatures
The highest temperature reached during a day is called the maximum
temperature and the lowest temperature during the day is called the minimum
temperature In order to prepare weather reports the maximum and minimum
temperatures are recorded at a place every day The maximum and minimum
temperatures reached during a whole day are recorded automatically by a special
thermometer called MaximumandMinimum thermometer see Figure 3 Please
remember that
i The maximum temperature of the day generally occurs in the afternoon and
ii The minimum temperature of the day generally occurs in the early morning
During summers we feel miserable in the afternoon because the maximum
temperature of the day is reached in the afternoon making the surroundings very hot and
unbearable On the other hand we feel comparatively cool and comfortable in the early
morning during summers because the minimum temperature of the day is reached in the
early morning making the surroundings somewhat cooler
In any month of a year all the seven days of the week do not have the same
maximum and minimum temperatures at a place The maximum and minimum
temperatures keep on changing day by day The maximum and minimum temperatures
recorded at Delhi for a week from 01 November 2008 to 07 November 2008 are given in
the following table A graph showing the variation of maximum temperature during this
week is given in Figure 4

By carefully monitoring the atmospheric conditions such as temperature pressure humidity wind
speed and wind direction sunshine cloud formations rainfall or snowfall etc it is possible to predict the
coming weather in advance Prediction of weather in advance is called weather forecasting Weather
experts use the various types of data collected by Earth Stations in different parts of the country as well as
by the Satellites orbiting high up in the sky to predict weather or forecast weather well in advance The
scientific study of weather is called meteorology The scientists who study and forecast weather are called
meteorologists

Weather Reports
We can see the daily weather reports in newspapers The weather reports are also read on radio and
shown on TV The daily weather report carries information
about the temperatures humidity and rainfall during the
past 24 hours It also gives the timings of sunrise sunset
moonrise and moonset The weather report also predicts the
weather for the day A sample of the weather report which
appeared in a newspaper on a Monday morning in the month
of November 2008 in Delhi is given in Figure 5
i The weather report given in Figure 5 tells us that the
maximum temperature during the past 24 hours was 33C
The figure 3 in brackets means that this maximum
Figure 5 A weather report which appeared in a
temperature is 3C above normal The minimum temperature
newspaper on a Monday morning in November
during the past 24 hours is shown to be 16C The figure 2 in 2008 in Delhi Max  Maximum Min
brackets means that this minimum temperature is 2C above Minimum
normal
ii The weather report tells us that the moon will set on Monday at 930 pm and moon will rise on
Tuesday at 1155 pm It also informs us that the sun will set on Monday at 534 pm and the sun will rise
on Tuesday at 636 am
iii The forecast of weather for the day given in the weather report tells us that  Sky will remain clear
which means no clouds etc but there will be mist in the morning The maximum and minimum
temperatures predicted for the day are around 33C and 17C respectively
iv The weather report given in Figure 5 also tells us that the maximum humidity recorded in the past
24 hours was 82 per cent and the minimum humidity was 29 per cent
v Since rainfall does not occur every day so no rainfall has been recorded in the above weather report
during the past 24 hours
Weather reports are prepared by the scientists called meteorologists of the Meteorology Department
of the Government Meteorological Department collects all the data on the condition of atmosphere like
temperature pressure wind speed wind direction humidity sunshine cloud formations rainfall or
snowfall etc from various sources and prepares the weather report
The times of sunrise and sunset also change during the year During summer sunrise is early and the
sunset is late Due to this days are longer in summers and nights are shorter On the other hand during
winter the sunrise is late but the sunset is early Due to this days are shorter in winter but nights are
longer From this discussion we conclude that days are shorter in winter than in summer
Weather Over a Week
Let us cut out the weather reports of the last one week from any newspaper We now record the
information regarding temperatures humidity and rainfall given in these weather reports in the form of a
table As an example the weather data for a full week at Delhi is given in the following table

From the above table we can see that all the seven days of the week do not have the same maximum
and minimum temperatures Similarly the maximum and minimum humidity values are also not the same
on all the seven days of a week It is possible that the maximum and minimum temperatures or maximum
and minimum humidity values may be the same on some of the days of a week but all the parameters are
not the same on any two days There is a considerable variation in the weather data such as temperature
humidity rainfall etc over a whole week

CLIMATE

The scientists called meteorologists record the weather at various places everyday The records of the
weather over the past several decades have been preserved These records help the meteorologists to
determine the weather pattern at a place The average weather pattern at a place taken over a long period
of time say 25 years is called the climate of that place For example if the temperature at a place is high
most of the time then we say that the climate of that place is hot And if there is also heavy rainfall on most
of the days at that place then we say that the climate of that place is hot and wet or hot and humid
Climate is called jalvayu in Hindi
There are four major types of climates in the world  polar climate temperate climate tropical
climate and desert climate A brief description of all these climates is given below
i Polar Climate Polar climate is always very cold In fact polar regions have the coldest climate in
the world The air is so cold in polar regions of the earth that water falls there as snow and not as rain
So the air contains very little water vapour or moisture at the poles Thus the polar climate is extremely cold
and dry
ii Temperate Climate A climate which is neither very hot in summer nor very cold in winter is called
temperate climate In temperate climate there is moderate rain and snowfall
iii Tropical Climate A climate having very high temperatures and high humidity is called tropical
climate Thus tropical climate is very hot and humid There is
usually a lot of rain in tropical climate
iv Desert Climate Desert climate is very hot during
the day There is little rain in desert areas so the desert
climate is also dry Thus desert climate is very hot and dry
Every place on the earth has its own climate Our
climate depends on our position on the earth and our
distance from the sun The climate is different at different
places around the world because these are not heated equally
by the sun The equator of earth is at the minimum distance
from the sun The regions around the equator of earth Figure 6 Regions of earth near the equator where
called tropical regions where the sun shines directly the sun shines directly overhead have a hotter
overhead get the maximum heat from the sun and have a climate than the regions farther away from the
very hot climate see Figure 6 As a region gets more and equator

99
more away from the equator towards the poles the amount of suns heat received by the region goes on
decreasing leading to gradually cooler climates The poles of the earth are at the maximum distance from
the sun Due to this the suns rays have to travel much more to reach the polar regions of earth which
makes them lose much of their heat The polar regions of earth near north pole and south pole of earth
receive the minimum amount of suns heat so the polar regions of earth have an extremely cold climate
We have just said that the climate in tropical regions is very hot whereas that in polar regions is extremely
cold Thus the tropical regions and polar regions are the two regions of the earth which have extreme
climatic conditions

Factors Which Affect Climate
i Temperature and rainfall are the two most important factors which determine the climate at a
place
ii Another factor which affects the climate of a place is its altitude  whether it is located on high
mountains or on plains flat ground A place at higher altitude will have a cooler climate than another
place on plains flat ground This is why hill stations always have a cool climate
iii A yet another factor which affects the climate at a place is its location with respect to the sea
whether it is located near the sea or far away from the sea Seawater heats up slowly and also cools down
slowly This has a moderating effect on the climate of coastal areas The temperatures in coastal areas are
neither very high nor very low
We will now compare the climates of two places in India which are very far apart from each other
These two places are Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir and Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala Before we
do that we should know how to find the mean temperature for a month The mean temperature for a given
month is found in two steps  First we find the average of temperatures recorded during the month Second
we calculate the average  of such average temperatures over many years This gives us the mean
temperature for that month The mean temperatures are found for the maximum as well as the minimum
temperatures for the month
Srinagar is situated at high altitude on a mountain in the Northern part of India whereas
Thiruvananthapuram is situated on plains flat ground at sealevel in the SouthWest part of India Srinagar
is located very far away from the sea whereas Thiruvananthapuram is located near the sea Srinagar is located
quite far away from the equator whereas Thiruvananthapuram is comparatively nearer to the equator So due to
their totally different positions on earth Srinagar and Thiruvananthapuram have entirely different climates
Some of the information about the climates mean temperatures and mean rainfall of Srinagar and
Thiruvananthapuram during the whole year is given in the following tables

If we look at the data given in the above tables carefully we can easily see the difference in the climates
of Srinagar and Thiruvananthapuram
i In Srinagar the temperatures round the year are neither very low nor very high Also the rainfall
is neither very low nor very high Thus Srinagar has a moderately hot and wet climate In general we can say
that Jammu and Kashmir has a moderately hot and wet climate It is like a temperate climate
ii In Thiruvananthapuram the temperatures round the year are quite high Also the rainfall is very
high Thus Thiruvananthapuram has a very hot and wet climate In general we can say that Kerala state has a
very hot and wet climate Actually Kerala has a typical tropical climate
Rajasthan state lies in the Western region of India In Rajasthan the temperature is very high during
most part of the year so it is very hot But during winter which lasts only for a few months the
temperature is quite low Rajasthan receives very little rainfall so it is dry Thus the climate of Rajasthan
is hot and dry This is the typical desert climate The NorthEast India like Assam receives rain for a major
part of the year therefore we can say that the climate of NorthEast India is wet
Please note that climate is not the same as weather Weather is the daytoday condition of the
atmosphere at a place whereas climate is the average weather pattern at a place taken over a long period
of time

CLIMATE AND ADAPTATIONS

Climate has a great effect on all the living organisms animals as well as plants A living organism can
survive in a particular habitat only if its body is suited or adapted to the climate of that habitat Animals
and plants develop special features in their body or develop certain habits to survive in their habitats or
surroundings The presence of specific body features or certain habits which enable an animal or a
plant to live in a particular habitat or surroundings is called adaptation The body features and habits
that help animals and plants to adapt to their particular habitats or surroundings are a result of the
process of evolution Adaptation is called anukulan in Hindi
Animals and plants are adapted to survive in climates in which they live Adaptation can help
animals to survive in their environment by enabling them to withstand climate such as extreme cold or hot
climate to obtain food to hide to keep safe or catch prey or to breathe etc For example polar bears have
two thick layers of fur and a thick layer of fat under their skin Both these body features of polar bears
are the adaptations to make them withstand the extremely cold climate of polar region so that they may
survive in their habitat
We will now study the adaptations of some animals to the climates in which they live As examples of
adaptations of animals to climatic conditions we will discuss only the animals living in two types of
habitats
i Polar regions and
ii Tropical rainforests
Our earth has two poles  north pole and south pole The areas situated near the poles of the earth
are called polar regions Some of the well known countries that belong to the polar regions of the earth are
Canada Greenland Denmark Iceland Norway Sweden Finland Alaska in USA and Siberian region of
Russia All these countries actually belong to the north polar region which is also called Arctic region The
south polar region of the earth is called Antarctic region or just Antarctica The polar regions of the earth
have an extremely cold climate
Tropical rainforests are thick forests which grow near both the sides of the equator of earth where
the climate is very hot and humid and rainfall is high Some of the countries where tropical rainforests
are found are India Malaysia Indonesia Brazil Republic of Congo Kenya Uganda and Nigeria
The polar regions and the tropical regions are the two regions of the earth which have severe climatic
conditions We will now describe the climatic conditions in both these habitats and how animals are
adapted to live in these climates Let us describe the polar region first

101

THE POLAR REGIONS
The polar regions of the earth have an extremely cold climate The polar regions are covered with ice
and snow and it is extremely cold for most part of the year For six months the sun does not set at the poles
while for the next six months the sun does not rise above the horizon During winter in polar regions the
temperature can be as low as 37C minus 37C The animals living in the polar regions have adapted to
the extremely cold climate by having some special features such as white colour thick layer of fur thick
skin a layer of fat under the skin strong sense of smell and big feet big paws for walking on soft snow
and swimming etc The two animals which live in polar regions are polar bears and penguins Polar
bears live in north pole region whereas penguins live in the south pole region of the earth We will now
understand how animals of the polar regions have adapted to live in the severely cold climate by taking the
examples of polar bear and penguins

Adaptations in Polar Bear
The polar bear is a large white bear which lives in north
polar regions of the earth see Figure 7 The polar bear feeds
mainly on fish and seal seal is an aquatic mammal The polar
bear lives in extremely cold climate of polar regions due to the
following adaptations
1 Polar bear has white colour which matches with its
surroundings Due to white colour polar bear is not visible
easily in the snowy white background and hence its prey is
unable to see it This adaptation of white colour helps the polar bear
to catch its prey The white colour of polar bear also protects it from its
predators who kill and eat it because it mixes well with the
snowy white surroundings due to which the predators cannot
Figure 7 Polar bear
see it easily
2 Polar bear has two thick layers of fur on its body This fur protects the polar bear from extreme
cold by preventing the loss of heat from its body Thus the two thick layers of fur keep the polar bear warm in
extremely cold climate by keeping its body heat in The polar bear has also fur on its feet and toes This protects
it from cold when it walks on snow and ice
3 Polar bear has a thick layer of fat under its skin This layer of fat insulates the body of polar bear
against heat loss and keeps it warm in cold climate Thus the thick layer of fat also protects the polar bear from
extreme cold
4 Polar bear has a rounded body and small ears to keep the body surface area to a minimum
compared to the body weight This reduces the heat loss from the body of polar bear
5 Polar bear has big feet or big paws to spread the weight of its body on snow which prevent it
from sinking into snow and make it walk on snow easily Polar bear has long curved and sharp claws
which help it to walk and run on slippery ice
6 Polar bear is a good swimmer The big feet or big paws help the polar bear to swim well Being a
fast swimmer helps the polar bear to catch its prey like seal in water very easily While swimming under water
polar bear can close its nostrils and remain under water for long durations
7 Polar bear has a very strong sense of smell The very strong sense of smell helps the polar bear in
locating and catching its prey for food
Adaptations in Penguins
Penguin is an animal which lives in extremely cold south polar region of the earth Penguin is a seabird which cannot fly see Figure 8 Penguins hunt for fish which they eat as food Penguins can live in the
extremely cold climate of the polar region due to the following adaptations

102

Figure 8 Penguins

1 Penguin is black and white in colour but still it merges well with the white background of ice and
snow
2 Penguin has thick skin and a layer of fat below its skin which protect it from extreme cold
3 Penguins live together in large numbers Penguins huddle together to keep themselves warm
4 Penguin has streamlined body flipperlike wings and webbed feet which make it a good swimmer
Being a good swimmer helps penguin in catching fish as prey
In addition to polar bears and penguins some other animals which live in polar regions are Musk
oxen Reindeers Arctic foxes Seals Whales many kinds of Fish and Birds

MIGRATION

The process in which a bird or other animal moves from one place to another in one season and
returns again in a different season is called migration Migration of birds or other animals is an
adaptation to escape the harsh and cold conditions of their normal habitat in winter so as to survive This
point will become more clear from the following
discussion The birds must remain warm to survive
When the winter sets in cold regions of the earth the
climate becomes extremely cold The birds which
normally live in these regions migrate fly off to far
flung warmer places to escape the extremely cold winter
climate and survive see Figure 9 And when the winter
season is over these birds fly back to their original
habitats in the cold regions
The birds which migrate from very cold regions to
warmer regions in winter and go back after the winter is
over are called migratory birds India is one of the
Figure 9 Some birds migrate to warmer regions to
destinations of many of the migratory birds coming from
escape the extreme cold of their normal habitat during
the very cold regions of the earth One of the most winter
common migratory bird which comes to India every
year for a few months is the Siberian crane see Figure 10 The normal habitat of Siberian crane is Siberia
which is a very cold place When winter sets in Siberia and it gets extremely cold the Siberian crane flies
thousands of kilometres and comes to warmer places in India such as Bharatpur in Rajasthan Sultanpur in

103

Haryana some wet lands of NorthEast and some other
parts of India The Siberian cranes stay in the warmer
places in India for a few months The Siberian cranes fly
back to Siberia when the winter ends there and climate
becomes favourable Thus the adaptation of migration
in Siberian crane is to escape the extremely cold winter
conditions in Siberia and survive by moving to warmer
regions
Some migratory birds travel as much as 15000
kilometres to escape the extremely cold climatic conditions
at home to reach warmer places where there is plenty of
food The migratory birds usually fly high up in the sky
where the wind flow is helpful and low temperature aids in Figure 10 The Siberian crane is a migratory bird
dispersing the heat generated by the constant working of
their flight muscles in flapping the wings An important question now arises  How do migratory birds
travel to the same place year after year  An exact answer to this question is still not available Some of the
probable reasons for how the migratory birds travel to the same place year after year are as follows
i It seems that the migratory birds have a builtin sense of direction which tells them in which
direction to fly to reach the same place
ii Some migratory birds probably use landmarks to guide them to reach the same place
iii Many migratory birds may be guided by the position of the sun during the day and by the position
of stars at night to reach the same place
iv There is also some evidence that the migratory birds may be using the magnetic field of earth to find
the direction so as to reach the same place
It is not only the birds which migrate Even mammals many types of fish and insects such as
butterflies are known to migrate seasonally in search of favourable climatic conditions and food For
example reindeer is a mammal which migrates Reindeers live in herds in the cold northern regions of
North America where they feed on grass and shrubs in the summer During winter when the snowfall
occurs all the grass and shrubs get buried in snow and reindeers do not get any food Due to this reindeers
migrate to the warmer regions in the south where they get sufficient food They return to the original
habitat in the north after a few months when the snow starts melting

THE TROPICAL RAINFORESTS

The area of earth near both sides of the equator is called tropical region The tropical region has
generally a hot climate because of its location around the equator During hot summer days the
temperature in this region may go above 40C Even in the coldest months the temperature is generally
higher than about 15C The tropical regions get plenty of rainfall This makes the region humid Thus the
tropical regions have hot and humid climate In tropical regions days and nights are almost equal in
length throughout the year An important feature of the tropical regions of earth is the tropical
rainforests see Figure 11 Tropical rainforests are found in India Southeast Asia Central America and
Central Africa In India tropical rainforests are found in Western Ghats and Assam Western Ghats is a
mountain range parallel to the West coast of India Western Ghats run through Maharashtra Karnataka
Tamil Nadu and Kerala states Because of highly favourable climatic conditions in tropical rainforests
such as continuous warmth and rain a large variety of plants and animals are found in tropical
rainforests The major types of animals living in the tropical rainforests are Lions Tigers Leopards
Elephants Monkeys Apes Liontailed macaque Gorillas Birds Snakes Lizards Frogs and Insects etc

Figure 11 A tropical rainforest

104

Since the number of animals living in the tropical rainforests is very large they are adapted such that
they eat different kinds of food to overcome competition for food and live in different kinds of places to
overcome competition for shelter Some of the adaptations in animals living in tropical rainforests are
A skin colour which helps them to camouflage mix up with the surroundings and hide in order to catch
prey or protect themselves from predators  Running very fast to catch prey or escape from predators
Development of trunk tusks and large ears and feet  Sharp eyesight Sensitive hearing and Thick skin
Living on trees Development of strong gripping tails  Long and large beaks  Bright colours and Loud
voice  Living on diet of fruits etc We will now describe the adaptations of some of the animals which help
them to live and survive in the tropical rainforest habitats

Adaptations in Big Cats
The wild animals such as lions and tigers etc are called big cats see Figure 12 The big cats are
carnivores which eat only the meat or
flesh of other animals The big cats hunt
and kill animals such as deer to obtain
food The big cats can live and survive in
the tropical rainforests due to the following
adaptations
1 The big cats lion and tiger have a
highly developed sense of smell which
helps them to locate their prey and kill for
Figure 12 Lion and tiger are called big cats
obtaining food Big cats also have
sensitive hearing This also helps to find their prey
2 The yellowbrown colour of lion and the yellowbrown colour with black stripes of tiger helps
them to hide in the forest without being seen easily This camouflage or blending with the
surroundings helps the big cats in catching their prey
3 The big cats lion and tiger have eyes in front of their head which enable them to have a correct
idea of the location of their prey This helps in catching the prey The big cats also have good eyesight for
hunting at night
4 The big cats lion and tiger can run very fast The high speed of running helps the big cats in
catching their prey

105
5 The big cats lion and tiger have long strong and sharp claws in their front legs to catch their
prey The big cats can withdraw pull in the claws inside the toes so that they do not get worn out and
blunt when they walk Big cats also have powerful teeth and jaws to kill large prey

Adaptations in Elephants
Elephant is a very large animal of Indian tropical rainforest see Figure 13 Elephants are plant eaters
Elephant has adapted to the conditions of rainforests in many remarkable ways The various adaptations
in elephant which help it live and survive in tropical rainforest habitat are as follows
1 One of the most important adaptation in an
elephant is its trunk which we can see in the front see
Figure 13 The trunk of an elephant is basically an
elongated nose which is also capable of grasping things
The trunk helps the elephant in many ways The elephant
uses the trunk to smell Because of the trunk elephant has a
strong sense of smell It is also used for breathing The
elephant uses its long trunk to pick up food like grass and plants
etc and put into its mouth The trunk of elephant can reach
up to the branches of trees and help it eat tree leaves as
food The elephant uses trunk for drinking water by
sucking up water and putting it into the mouth The
elephant also uses the trunk to bathe itself
2 Another good adaptation of the elephant are its
Figure 13 An Indian elephant
tusks Tusks are the big and long pointed teeth which come
out from the closed mouth of the elephant see Figure 13 Tusks are the modified teeth of elephant Tusks
are actually the incisor teeth of elephant Elephant uses the tusks to obtain food as follows  Elephant uses the tusks
to tear off the bark of trees which it eats as food An elephant has two tusks and four teeth The elephants four
teeth are inside the mouth The elephants four teeth are molars for chewing and grinding food Elephants
also use the tusks for fighting their enemies and protecting themselves
3 The elephant has large ears The large ears of elephant help it to hear even very soft sounds Due to
large ears an elephant can hear even the slightest sound made by its predator behind him so that it can sense the
danger and run away to safety When the temperature rises the elephants flap their large ears and use them
as fans to cool themselves So the large ears also help the elephant to keep cool in the hot and humid climate of the
tropical rainforest
4 An elephant is very heavy The elephant is adapted to support its great weight and prevent it from
sinking into soft ground The elephants feet are large and round The large and round feet give good stability
to the elephant and also prevent it from sinking into soft ground by spreading its weight over a larger area
We have just studied that big cats lions and tigers and elephants live on ground but they have
different eating habits Big cats eat flesh of animals whereas elephants eat grass and other plants Due to
their different food habits big cats and elephants do not compete for food There are however many other
animals in the tropical rainforests deer etc which compete with elephants for grass and other plant food
In order to overcome the competition for food and shelter on the ground many animals live on the trees
in the tropical rainforests Some of the animals which are adapted to live on the trees are  Redeyed
frogs Toucans Monkeys and Liontailed macaques We will now describe the important adaptations in
these animals which help them live and survive on the trees
Adaptations in RedEyed Frog
Redeyed frog lives on the trees in the tropical rainforests so it is also called redeyed tree frog It does
not live in water The redeyed frog has a green back and a creamy underside It has big and bulging
brightred eyes see Figure 14 Redeyed frog is nocturnal It sleeps during the day and becomes active and

106

feeds mainly at night Redeyed frog spends most of the day hidden on
the underside of tree leaves The various adaptations which help the
redeyed frog to live and survive on the trees in the rainforest habitat
are as follows
1 Redeyed frog has developed sticky pads on its feet which help
it to climb easily on the trees on which it lives The sticky pads on feet
also allow the redeyed frog to attach itself to the branches and leaves
of the trees
2 The big and bulging brightred eyes of this frog are an
adaptation for protection This can be explained as follows  If a
predator enemy wakes up the sleeping redeyed frog during daytime Figure 14 Redeyed frog which lives
its big and bright red eyes pop open suddenly The sudden opening of on the trees
big and brightred eyes frightens the predator for a while and the frog gets time to jump to a safe place
3 The green colour of redeyed frog helps it to hide within the green leaves of the tree unnoticed
by its prey This helps it in catching its prey like insects etc The hiding of redeyed frog by mixing up with
leaves due to its green colour also protects it from its predators because they cannot see it easily
4 Redeyed frog has very good eyesight which helps it to see very clearly at night
5 Redeyed frog is a carnivore and eats any type of insects as food

Adaptations in Toucan
As there is competition for food even on the trees some animals are
adapted to get food from trees which is not reachable easily like the fruits
at the ends of very thin branches An example of the animal which is
adapted to get food from the fruits attached at the ends of even very thin
branches is toucan Toucan is a colourful bird with a strange looking
beak see Figure 15 Toucans beak is long and large It has brightly
coloured feathers Toucan lives on the trees in tropical rainforests It spends
most of the time in the holes of big trees Toucan eats fruits of the trees The
various adaptations which help the toucan to live and survive in its habitat
on the trees in rainforests are as follows
1 Toucan has a long and large beak The long and large beak helps a
toucan to reach the fruits attached to the ends of even thin branches of trees
which are too weak to support its weight Thus long and large beak is an
Figure 15 Toucan A fruit eating
adaptation in toucan for getting the otherwise unreachable fruits at the ends of bird with a long and large beak
very thin branches of trees The large beak also helps in the temporary storage
of fruits being collected by toucan
2 The feet of toucan are adapted for grasping the branches of trees
firmly This happens as follows The toucan has four toes with claws on each
foot  two toes pointing forward and two toes pointing backward This
arrangement of toes helps the toucan to get a firm grip on the branches of trees
without falling down
3 Toucan has the ability to change the colour of its feathers in order to
blend or mix up with the surroundings Due to this adaptation toucan is not
noticed easily by the predators and hence remains safe
Adaptations in Monkey
The monkey is a small to medium sized animal usually having a long tail
which normally lives on trees in tropical rainforests see Figure 16 Monkeys
Figure 16 Monkey

107
simply sleep on convenient tree branches without making nests The main adaptations in monkeys which
help them live and survive on the trees in tropical rainforests are as follows
1 Monkeys are expert climbers The hands and feet of monkeys are adapted in such a way that they
can easily hold on to the branches of trees
2 Monkeys have long and strong gripping tails which they use for grasping branches of trees
Actually monkeys use their long and strong tail like an extra hand to hold on to the branches of trees
3 Monkeys have very good eyesight The very good eyesight helps the monkeys in leaping between
the branches to escape from their predators
4 In the rainforest habitat monkeys eat fruits seeds leaves roots and insects as food

Adaptations in LionTailed Macaque
The liontailed macaque is a kind of medium sized monkey with a long
face and cheek pouches for holding food while it is being collected It is called
liontailed because its tail is like that of a lion having tufts of hair bunch of
hair at the end The most outstanding feature of liontailed macaque is its
silverwhite mane which surrounds its head from the cheeks down to its
chin see Figure 17 A growth of long hair on the neck of macaque is called
mane The mane of liontailed macaque appears to be like a beard so the
liontailed macaque is also called beard ape Liontailed macaques are
unique to India The liontailed macaques live in the rainforests of Western
Ghats in India The liontailed macaques spend most of the time feeding in
the upper canopy of trees in the rainforests The various adaptations in liontailed macaques which help them live and survive on the trees in tropical
rainforests are as follows
1 The liontailed macaque is a good climber and spends most of its
time high up in trees The hand and feet of liontailed macaque are adapted
Figure 17 Liontailed
to hold on to the branches of trees firmly
macaque or Beard ape
2 The liontailed macaque has very good eyesight which helps it in
leaping between the branches This adaptation is useful in moving from one tree to another in search of
food and also to escape from predators
3 The liontailed macaque feeds mainly on fruits on the trees It also eats seeds leaves stems
flowers and buds The liontailed macaque also searches for insects under the bark of trees and eats them
Since liontailed macaque gets sufficient food on the trees it rarely comes down on the ground

Winds Storms
and Cyclones

e live on the earth and there is a lot of air around us Air is a mixture of colourless gases so we
cannot see air The layer of air above the earth is called atmosphere The atmosphere contains
a tremendous amount of air About 99 per cent of atmosphere is made up of just two gases
nitrogen and oxygen The amount of water vapour in the atmosphere depends on temperature and
humidity The earths atmosphere extends to a height of several hundred kilometres above the earth but
most of the air lies within about 10 kilometres of the earths surface The atmosphere exerts a pressure
called atmospheric pressure due to the weight of air contained in it The atmospheric pressure decreases
with height Even the small changes in atmospheric pressure can bring about considerable changes in the
weather on earth All the phenomena such as winds storms and cyclones etc occur in the earths
atmosphere In this Chapter we will study the formation of winds storms and cyclones and their effects
Before we go further we will discuss the two important properties of air which are  air exerts pressure and
air expands on heating and becomes lighter

AIR EXERTS PRESSURE
The continuous physical force exerted on an object or against an object by something in contact
with it is called pressure Air exerts pressure Actually air exerts pressure in different ways under
different situations For example
i Air enclosed in a container like a balloon or bicycle tube exerts pressure
ii Air in the atmosphere around us exerts pressure and
iii Moving air called wind exerts pressure
We will now describe the pressure exerted by air under different conditions in detail one by one
Air is a mixture of gases Air is made up of tiny particles called molecules which move around
quickly in all directions The moving air molecules or gas molecules are so small that we cannot see them
112

113
If we put air in a closed container say a balloon then the fast moving air molecules collide with the walls
of the container and exert a force on the walls of the container from inside This force produces pressure
Now if we put more air into the container then the container will have more air molecules in it Due to
more air molecules the number of collisions of air molecules with the walls of the container will increase
and hence the pressure exerted by air will also increase The fact that air exerts pressure can be
demonstrated by the following activity

Figure 1 Air filled in these balloons exerts
pressure and inflates them

Take a rubber balloon and fill air into it with mouth We will find
that on filling air the balloon gets inflated it expands and becomes
bigger in size see Figure 1 This can be explained as follows  When
we put air in the balloon then the number of air molecules in the
balloon increases These air molecules cause collisions with the
rubber walls of balloon and create an air pressure The air pressure
acting on the thin rubber walls of the balloon from inside causes the
balloon to expand and get inflated Just like balloon a football also
gets inflated when air is filled in it The football gets inflated because
the air filled in it exerts pressure

ACTIVITY

Let us take the example of bicycle tube now The bicycle tube is a rubber tube which is enclosed inside
the tyre of the bicycle We have to fill air in the bicycle tube to inflate it This air is filled by using an air
pump called bicycle pump When we fill air into the bicycle tube then the air molecules inside the tube
collide with the walls of the tube and exert air pressure This air pressure exerted from inside inflates the
bicycle tube So it is the pressure exerted by air filled in a bicycle tube which keeps the tube tight and
makes the bicycle tyre feel hard If we go on filling more and more air into bicycle tube with a pump
then ultimately the air pressure in the bicycle tube will increase too much due to which the bicycle tube
may even burst  Thus the two observations or experiences which tell us that air exerts pressure are as
follows
i When air is filled into a balloon with our mouth the balloon gets inflated This observation shows
that air exerts pressure
ii When air is filled into a bicycle tube with a pump the bicycle tube gets inflated and makes the
bicycle tyre feel hard This observation also shows that air exerts pressure

From the above discussion we conclude that when air is filled in a closed container like a balloon
or a bicycle tube it exerts pressure This air pressure is due to the motion of the molecules of gases
present in air which is enclosed in the container We will now describe another type of air pressure called
atmospheric pressure which is due to the weight of air present in the atmosphere above the surface of
earth
The atmosphere contains a tremendous amount of air Air has weight so the atmosphere consisting of
tremendous amount of air has enormous weight The weight of atmosphere or air above us exerts a
pressure on the surface of earth and on all the objects on the earth This pressure is known as atmospheric
pressure We can now say that atmospheric pressure is the air pressure which is exerted by the weight
of air present in the atmosphere above us The magnitude of atmospheric pressure is very large As we
go to higher altitudes the atmospheric pressure goes on decreasing because the weight of air above us
goes on decreasing Atmospheric pressure acts in all directions  downwards sideways and even upwards
We will now describe the crushing a tin can activity to show the existence of air pressure or
atmospheric pressure around us This activity will also show that the magnitude of atmospheric pressure
is very large Tin can is a vessel made of a thin and flexible metal sheet An empty tin can has air inside it

114
as well as outside it So the air pressure or atmospheric pressure acting on the walls of an empty tin can
from inside and outside is equal and opposite and balance each other Due to this an empty tin can which
contains air does not get crushed by the large atmospheric pressure exerted by the air around us We will
now perform an activity to show what happens when air from inside the tin can is removed

ACTIVITY TO SHOW THAT AIR AROUND US EXERTS PRESSURE

a The outside air pressure on tin
can is balanced by the steam
pressure from inside So tin
can does not get crushed

Take a tin can and put some water in it see Figure 2a Heat the tin can by using a burner to boil the
water so that steam is formed This steam expels all the air from inside the tin can so that when water is
boiling there is no air inside the can the whole can is filled with steam see Figure 2a A tight cork is now
fitted in the mouth of the tin can and heating is stopped We now pour cold water from a tap on the hot tin

b The air pressure acting from
outside crushes the tin can
because there is no steam pressure
from inside to balance it

Figure 2 Activity to show the existence of air pressure or atmospheric pressure around us

can On pouring cold water the tin can collapses inwards as if a large force acting on it from outside has
crushed it see Figure 2b These observations can be explained as follows
i When the water is boiling steam is formed in the tin can see Figure 2a Steam has pressure The
steam pressure acting from inside the tin can balances the air pressure or atmospheric pressure acting on
all the sides of the tin can from outside and hence the tin can does not get crushed
ii When a tight cork is put on the mouth of the tin can containing steam and then cold water is
poured over it then the hot steam inside the tin can gets cooled condenses and forms water and water
vapour at very low pressure Thus on cooling the pressure inside the tin can decreases too much and it
cannot balance the large air pressure or atmospheric pressure acting on the tin can from outside So the
large air pressure or atmospheric pressure outside the tin can crushes the tin can inwards see Figure 2b
The crushing of tin can having very low pressure inside it shows the existence of a large air pressure or large
atmospheric pressure around it So this activity confirms that air around us exerts pressure
A yet another type of force or pressure is exerted by air when it starts moving Moving air is called
wind Moving air or wind exerts a force or pressure on the objects on which it strikes An object which
is moving is said to possess kinetic energy The force or pressure exerted by the moving air or wind is
due to the kinetic energy possessed by it Some of the observations from our daily life which tell us that
moving air or wind exerts pressure are as follows
i If the air around us is not blowing we will find that the leaves of trees flags and banners etc do
not move at all they remain standstill But when the air blows then the leaves of trees flags and banners
start fluttering moving with irregular motion It is due to the pressure exerted by moving air or wind

115

that the leaves of trees flags and banners flutter when the wind is blowing see Figure 3 A long strip
of cloth used to display advertisements is called a banner and a large board used to display advertisements
is called a hoarding Holes are usually made in hanging banners and hoardings so that high speed wind
may pass through them easily without damaging them or bringing them down with its huge force or
pressure

Figure 4 Moving air or wind exerts a
force or pressure due to which it is
difficult to ride a bicycle against the
direction of wind

Figure 3 The force or pressure exerted by
moving air or wind is making the leaves
of these trees flutter and also bending
their branches

ii While riding a bicycle we find that it is easier to move the bicycle forward if the wind is coming
from our back side It is easier to ride a bicycle in the direction of blowing wind because the blowing wind
exerts a force or pressure on us in the same direction in which our bicycle is moving and makes our bicycle
move faster On the other hand we find it very difficult to ride a bicycle against the direction of wind see
Figure 4 This is because in this case the blowing wind exerts a force on us in the direction opposite to the
motion of our bicycle And since the wind opposes our motion we have to pedal very hard to keep the
bicycle moving against the wind
iii While rowing a boat in the lake we find it easier to row the boat forward if the wind is coming
from behind us This is because the blowing wind exerts pressure on the boat and on the persons sitting
in it in the direction of their motion and helps it move forward On the other hand it becomes much more
difficult to row a boat against the direction of blowing wind because in this case the wind exerts a pressure
opposite to the direction of motion of boat And since the wind opposes the motion of boat we have to
apply much more force to row the boat against the direction of wind
iv When we are flying a kite then the wind coming from our back side helps This is because the
wind coming from our back side strikes the kite and exerts pressure on the kite to make it fly higher and
higher We can however not fly the kite against the direction of wind This is because in this case the
pressure of blowing wind will make the kite fall to the ground
All the above observations or experiences show that moving air or wind exerts a force or pressure
on all the objects which come in its way If the wind blows in the same direction in which the object is
moving it makes the movement of object easier On the other hand if the wind blows in opposite direction
to the motion of the object it makes the movement of the object difficult
Before we go further we should know the meaning of the terms expansion of air and contraction of
air The term expansion of air means increase in the volume of air and the term contraction of air
means decrease in the volume of air Air expands on heating and contracts on cooling In other words
when air is heated its volume increases and it occupies a bigger space And when air gets cooled then its

116
volume decreases and it occupies a smaller space We will now discuss the expansion of air on heating in
detail

AIR EXPANDS ON HEATING
When air is heated its volume increases and it occupies a bigger space We say that air expands on
heating The fact that air expands on heating can be demonstrated by performing an activity as follows

ACTIVITY

i Take a boiling tube The empty boiling tube contains air though we cannot see this air Take a balloon
stretch the mouth of the balloon and fix it tightly over the neck of the boiling tube as shown in Figure 5a
Make the joint of balloon with the neck of boiling tube airtight by wrapping some adhesive tape over it

b When boiling tube is placed in hot
water the air present in boiling tube gets
heated expands and inflates the balloon

a A balloon tied over the
neck of a boiling tube
which contains air

Figure 5 Air expands on heating

ii Take some hot water in a beaker Place the boiling tube having rubber balloon fixed to its neck
in the hot water in the beaker After 23 minutes we will see that the balloon gets inflated as if someone
has filled air in it see Figure 5b This can be explained as follows  When the boiling tube is placed in
hot water the air present in boiling tube gets heated expands and its volume increases The increased
volume of air fills the balloon due to which the balloon gets inflated So it is the expansion of air on
heating which inflates the balloon when the boiling tube is placed in hot water From this activity we
conclude that air expands on heating
If we take out the boiling tube from hot water and allow it to cool then after some time the balloon
will get deflated and come back to its original size This is because the air present in boiling tube and
balloon contracts on cooling due to which its volume decreases and balloon gets deflated
Hot Air or Warm Air is Lighter Than Cold Air
We have just studied that air expands on heating and occupies more space Now when the same air
occupies more space it becomes lighter or less heavy This means that hot air is lighter than cold air
Now when air gets heated at a place it expands becomes lighter and rises up in the sky In other words
hot air or warm air rises up We will now describe an activity to show that hot air is lighter less dense
than cold air and being lighter hot air rises upwards

ACTIVITY
i Take two paper bags or paper cups of exactly the same size Hang the two paper bags in the inverted
position with their open faces pointing downwards on the two sides of a light wooden stick with the help
of short threads see Figure 6a Tie a piece of thread in the middle of the stick The other end of this thread

117

is tied to a hook in the roof of a verandah The wooden stick with two paper bags tied to its two ends will
hang like a common beam balance Initially the wooden stick is perfectly horizontal showing that the two
paper bags contain an equal mass of the same air cold air see Figure 6a

a

Figure 6 Hot air is lighter than cold air and rises up

ii Put a burning candle below the open mouth of the left side paper bag see Figure 6b We will see
that after some time the left side of the wooden stick goes up showing that it has become lighter than the
right side see Figure 6b This observation can be explained as follows  When a burning candle is placed
below the left side paper bag the air above the candle flame gets heated The hot air being lighter rises up
and fills the left side paper bag by displacing the heavier cold air from it Since the left side paper bag now
contains hot air which is lighter than cold air present in right side paper bag therefore the left end of
wooden stick becomes lighter and moves up see Figure 6b

The above activity gives us two conclusions about the nature of hot air
i hot air is lighter than cold air and
ii being lighter hot air rises up
The fact that hot air is lighter than cold air and rises up is utilised in launching hot air balloons
see Figure 7 A white grey or black substance formed of small particles emitted from a burning
substance is called smoke Smoke always rises up This can be
explained as follows  Smoke is produced by the burning of a
substance therefore smoke is always accompanied by hot air or
warm air Since warm air is lighter than cold air therefore smoke
contained in warm air always rises up The air inside a house gets
warmed by the body heat of all the persons living in the house and
also by the burning of fuels LPG etc in the kitchen If we want to
buy a house then we should buy a house having windows as well
as ventilators The windows are for bringing in fresh air from
outside into the house The ventilators located near the roof of house take
out the warm and stale air from inside the house The presence of
ventilators in the house increases our comfort
In nature there are several situations when air at a place gets
heated becomes lighter and rises up When air at a place gets heated Figure 7 Hot air balloons go up because
and rises up then the pressure at that place is lowered or reduced the hot air filled in them is lighter less
The cold air from the surrounding areas being at higher pressure dense than the surrounding cold air

118
rushes in to fill the space vacated by hot rising air This leads to blowing of winds We will now describe
the formation of winds in detail

HOW WIND IS PRODUCED

Wind is the movement of air which depends on the difference in air pressures or atmospheric
pressures in the two regions Air moves or flows from the regions of high air pressure to regions of low
air pressure in the atmosphere The greater the difference in air pressure the faster the air moves Thus the speed
of wind depends on the difference in air pressures between the two regions The greater the difference in
air pressures between two regions the faster the wind blows The differences in air pressures or
atmospheric pressures in different regions of the earth which cause wind to blow are created in nature due
to the uneven heating or unequal heating on the earth in these regions Thus uneven heating on the earth
in different regions is the main cause of wind movements So in order to understand how winds are
produced we should first know which regions or areas of earth get more heat from the sun and which
regions of earth receive less heat from the sun leading to an unequal heating on the earth This is discussed
below
The equator of earth is at the minimum distance from the sun see Figure 8 so the region around the
equator of earth called equatorial region gets the maximum heat from the sun and hence it is very hot As
a region gets more and more away from the equator towards the poles the amount of suns heat received
by the region goes on decreasing gradually leading to less hot climates or cooler climates The poles of the
earth north pole and south pole are at the maximum distance from the sun and hence get the minimum
heat from the sun So the polar regions of the earth are very cold
The angular distance of a place or region north or south of the earths equator is represented by
latitude which is measured in degrees Equator of earth has 0 latitude zero degree latitude North pole
of earth has 90N latitude 90 degrees North latitude whereas South pole of earth has 90S latitude 90
degrees South latitude see Figure 8 A latitude of 30N 30 degrees North means a place on the earths
surface which is 30 degrees North of equator A latitude of 60N 60 degrees North means a place which
is 60 degrees North of equator A latitude of 30S 30 degrees South means a place which is 30 degrees
South of equator Similarly a latitude of 60S 60 degrees South means a place which is 60 degrees South
of the equator Keeping these points in mind we will now describe how winds are produced or generated
in nature

WIND IS PRODUCED DUE TO UNEVEN HEATING ON THE EARTH BY THE SUN

Wind blows due to the difference in the air pressures or atmospheric pressures in the two regions
These differences in air pressures are created by the uneven heating unequal heating on the earth in the
two regions So we can now say that  Wind is produced due to uneven heating on the earth by the sun
The uneven heating on the earth which produces winds can take place under two situations
i Uneven heating between the equator and poles of the earth and
ii Uneven heating of land and water of oceans
We will now describe how wind is produced in both these situations one by one
1 Wind is Produced by the Uneven Heating Between Equator and Poles of Earth
The regions close to the equator of earth get the maximum heat from the sun so the air in equatorial
regions gets heated and becomes warm see Figure 8 The warm air rises in the equatorial regions of earth
creating an area of low air pressure The cooler air from the regions of up to 30 degrees latitude belt on both
the sides of the equator being at higher pressure rushes towards the equator to take the place of warm
rising air This makes the wind to blow from the north and south directions towards the equator see Figure
8 Again the air at latitudes of about 60 degrees on both sides of the equator is warmer than at the poles
which is very cold So the warmer air at about 60 degrees latitudes rises up creating regions of low air

119

pressure and cold air from the polar regions being at higher
pressure rushes in to take its place This makes the winds blow
from the poles of the earth towards the warmer regions up to
about 60 degrees latitudes These winds also blow from the north
and south directions towards the warmer latitude regions see
Figure 8
Please note that the winds shown in Figure 8 by the arrows
are not blowing in the exact northsouth direction The winds
produced by the uneven heating on the earth between the equator
and the poles would have blown in the exactly northsouth
direction from north to south or from south to north if the
earth did not rotate on its axis The winds produced by the
uneven heating of the earth between the equator and the poles
do not blow in the exact northsouth direction because a change
in the direction of winds is caused by the rotation of the earth on
Figure 8 The wind flow pattern due to uneven
its axis see Figure 8
2 Wind is Produced by the Uneven Heating of Land and Water heating between the equator and poles of the
earth
in Oceans
In summer land near the equator of earth heats up faster than
the water in oceans so most of the time the temperature of land is higher than that of water in oceans The
air over the land gets heated and rises creating a low pressure area The cooler air from over the oceans
being at higher pressure rushes towards the land This causes the wind to blow from the oceans towards
the land The winds blowing from the oceans towards the land in summer are called monsoon winds
The monsoon winds carry a lot of water from the oceans in the form of water vapour and bring large
amount of rains on land The process in which the winds coming from the oceans carry a lot of water
vapour and bring rains is a part of the water cycle in nature
In India the land especially the Rajasthan desert gets heated much more in summer than the water
in the Indian ocean This uneven heating of land and water in Indian ocean during summer generates
monsoon winds from the Indian ocean The monsoon winds coming from the southwest direction in
summer carry a lot of water vapour from the Indian ocean and bring heavy rains known as monsoon
or rainy season see Figure 9a The summer monsoon is very important to the farmers in our country
because most of the annual rainfall occurs at this time and helps in growing crops Many farmers in our
country depend mainly on rains for the irrigation of their crops

b Winds blowing from northwest direction in winter
when the land is hotter than water in ocean
when the land is colder than water in ocean
Figure 9 Winds generated by the uneven heating of land and water in oceans

120
We have just learnt that during summer wind blows from the oceans towards land In winter the
direction of wind flow gets reversed During winter wind blows from the land towards the ocean This
happens as follows  During winter land cools down faster than the water in oceans So the temperature
of water in oceans is higher than that of land The warm air over the oceans rises up creating a region of
low pressure and cooler air from the land rushes towards the ocean This causes wind to blow from land
towards the oceans The winds coming from colder land regions or colder winds carry only a little of
water vapour and hence bring only a small amount of rain in winter season
In India the land especially the northwest region gets cooled much more in winter than the water
in Indian ocean This uneven heating of land and water in Indian ocean during winter generates winds
from the northwest colder land going towards the Indian ocean see Figure 9b The colder winds coming
from the northwest direction in winter carry only a small amount of water vapour and hence bring only a
small amount of rain in winter season

HIGH SPEED WINDS ARE ACCOMPANIED BY REDUCED AIR PRESSURE

Fast moving air creates a region of low pressure Since moving air is called wind therefore we can also
say that fast blowing wind creates a region of low pressure Now fast wind means high speed wind and
low pressure means reduced air pressure So a yet another way of saying this is that high speed winds
are accompanied by reduced air pressure We will now describe some activities which will show that fast
moving wind creates a region of low air pressure or reduced air pressure

ACTIVITY 1
Take two balloons of equal size Fill a little water into both the balloons to make them slightly heavier
Inflate both the balloons by filling air into them with mouth or pump and tie their mouths properly with
strong threads Hang the two inflated balloons about 10 cm apart on a stick with the help of threads tied to
their mouths see Figure 10a

a Two inflated balloons containing
a little water each hanging from a stick

b When air or wind is blown in the space
between the two balloons they come closer

Figure 10 Activity to show that fast moving air or wind creates a region of low air pressure

If we blow air or wind in the space between the two balloons from our mouth we will see that the
two balloons come closer see Figure 10b This can be explained as follows  When we blow air or wind
between the balloons then the fast moving air or fast moving wind creates a region of low air pressure in
the space between the two balloons The air pressure on the outside of the balloons being higher pushes the
two balloons towards each other and makes them come closer So this activity shows that the fast moving
air or fast moving wind creates a region of low air pressure or reduced air pressure
ACTIVITY 2
Take a piece of paper and crumple it to make a small paper ball Hold an empty glass bottle on its side
horizontally and place the small paper ball in the neck of the bottle just inside its mouth see Figure 11
Let us now blow air into the bottle from our mouth When we blow air into the bottle the paper ball kept in

121
the neck of the bottle remains unaffected the paper ball does not go
inside the bottle see Figure 11 This can be explained as follows
When we blow air into the mouth of the bottle then the air in the
neck of bottle has high speed This fast moving air reduces the air
pressure in the neck of the bottle The air pressure inside the bottle
being higher constantly pushes the paper ball out and does not allow
it to go inside the bottle So this activity also shows that increased
wind speed is accompanied by a reduced air pressure

The fast moving air or high speed wind blowing over an
object can also lift the object up by producing a region of low
pressure above it This will become clear from the following
Figure 11 When we blow air into the
activity

Figure 12 When air is blown over paper
strip the paper strip lifts up

Hold a strip of paper about 20 cm long and 3 cm wide just
below your lips and blow air over its surface from your mouth
We will find that the strip of paper lifts up see Figure 12 This
can be explained as follows  When we blow air over the surface
of paper strip the fast moving air creates a region of low air
pressure above the paper strip The air pressure below the paper
strip being higher pushes the paper strip upwards and lifts it up
This activity shows that fast moving air is accompanied by low air
pressure or reduced air pressure In other words increased wind
speed is accompanied by a reduced air pressure

ACTIVITY 3

bottle the small paper ball kept in its neck
does not go inside the bottle easily

We have just learnt that when air is blown over a strip of paper then the strip of paper is lifted up
because the fast moving air reduces the pressure above the paper strip and higher air pressure acting from
below the paper strip lifts it up If high speed winds blow over the roofs of houses they will reduce the
air pressure above the roofs And if the roofs of houses are weak then higher air pressure from below
will lift up the roofs which can then be blown away by the fast winds Thus weak roofs of houses like
the tin roofs or thatched roofs can be lifted and blown away by high speed winds during a windstorm

Wind Speed and Wind Direction
Wind speed and wind direction play an important role in the formation of storms such as
thunderstorms cyclones and tornadoes It is therefore necessary to measure wind speed and wind
direction at a place The wind speed is measured by an instrument called anemometer see Figure 13
The most common type of anemometer consists of 3 or 4 cups mounted on a rod which can rotate freely
The cups catch the wind and rotate The greater the speed of wind the faster the cups rotate At the base of
the anemometer is a scale The speed of wind in kilometres per hour is read from this scale The
anemometer is installed on a tall mast where the wind blows freely around it
The wind can blow from different directions The direction of wind at a place is found by using an
instrument called wind vane see Figure 14 We can find the direction from which wind is blowing by
looking at the wind vane The arrow of wind vane rotates freely The arrow of wind vane moves until it
points to the direction from which the wind is blowing If the arrow points to the south it shows that the
wind is blowing from the south direction see Figure 14

High Speed Winds Can be Destructive
We have just studied that winds bring us rains This is a useful part played by winds But high speed
winds called strong winds can also be destructive sometimes High speed winds create certain situations
in nature which create disasters and pose a threat to the life of human beings and other animals Houses
other buildings and standing crops are also destroyed in these disasters Wind plays an important role in
the formation of thunderstorms cyclones and tornadoes which can cause disasters We will now discuss
the formation of thunderstorms cyclones and tornadoes and their effects Before we do that we should
know the meaning of the terms  storm lightning and thunder These are discussed below
i Storm A period of violent weather with strong winds and usually rain or snow is called a storm
A storm is the disturbed state of the earths atmosphere which affects the surface of earth and all the objects
on it Storm is called toofan in Hindi
ii Lightning A natural flow of high voltage electricity within a cloud or between a cloud and the
earth which appears as a bright flash of light in the sky is called lightning Please note that for a cloud to
become electrically charged and produce lightning its temperature must be close to the freezing point of
water which is 0C We will explain it further when we discuss the formation of a thunderstorm after a
while Lightning is usually accompanied by thunder
iii Thunder The loud sound which is heard a little after a lightning flash is seen in the sky is called
thunder Thunder is produced by lightning as follows  The high voltage electric spark of lightning heats
the air in the atmosphere to a very high temperature This
extreme heating causes the air to expand at an explosive
rate producing a loud sound called thunder Thus it is
lightning which causes thunder As we will study after a
while lightning and thunder are the two characteristic
features of a thunderstorm

THUNDERSTORM
Many times during a storm which brings heavy rain
we also hear loud sound called thunder coming from the
clouds and see the bright flashes of lightning as well A
storm with thunder and lightning is called thunderstorm
A thunderstorm is accompanied by heavy rains or hail
The pellets of frozen rain or ice falling in showers from
clouds is called hail Thunderstorm is produced by the
dark clouds which form at fairly low altitude in the

Figure 15 A thunderstorm

123

atmosphere Thunderstorm is called garajwala toofan in Hindi Thunderstorms develop in hot and humid
tropical areas like India very frequently This is because the heat of tropical area warms up the air and
makes it rise up whereas humidity provides the water vapour for the formation of clouds A thunderstorm
is formed as follows
The sun heats the surface of earth The hot surface of earth warms the air in contact with it The warm
air being lighter rises up creating a low pressure area And cool air rushes in to take its place in the form
of strong winds As the warm air rises it transfers heat to the upper levels of atmosphere and begins to
cool The water vapour present in the rising air cool and condense to form a cloud The cloud grows
upwards into areas where the temperature is close to the freezing point of water 0C Some of the water
vapour of cloud forms tiny water droplets and some of it turns into ice particles The water droplets are
carried upwards in the cloud by convection currents but the ice particles drift downwards The friction
between fast rising water droplets in the cloud and falling ice particles produces opposite electric charges
on them the water droplets getting positive electric charge and ice particles acquiring negative electric
charge Due to this the top of cloud becomes positively charged and the bottom of cloud becomes
negatively charged When a large amount of opposite electric charges build up in the cloud a tremendous
amount of electric current passes through the air in the cloud which produces a big electric spark within
the cloud This electric spark is the lightning see Figure 15 The spark of lightning heats the nearby air too
much This extremely hot air expands explosively causing a loud sound called thunder When electric
charges from the bottom of the electrically charged cloud flow down through the air to the ground then
we see the flash of lightning coming towards the earth The big water drops in the thundercloud fall to the
earth as heavy rain or hail In this way a thunderstorm brings strong winds thunder lightning and heavy
rains or hail

Precautions To be Taken During a Thunderstorm
A thunderstorm is always accompanied by lightning Lightning is a giant electric spark When
lightning strikes the earth it can kill people It also damages buildings We should take the following
precautions during a thunderstorm to protect ourselves from lightning
i We should not sit near a window during lightning Open garages storage sheds and metal sheds are
also not safe places to take shelter during lightning
ii We should not take shelter under an umbrella with a metallic end during lightning This is because
metallic end of umbrella may act as a conductor for lightning and harm us
iii We should not take shelter under an isolated and tall tree This is because an isolated tall tree is more
likely to be hit by lightning due to its nearness to the clouds We should take shelter under a small
tree We should however not lie on the ground during lightning
iv A car or a bus is a safe place to take shelter during lightning because its metal body can conduct
lightning to earth safely without harming us
v If we are in water as in a swimming pool or on a beach when the thunderstorm begins and
lightning takes place we should get out of water and go inside a building
Before we describe a cyclone it is necessary to know what supplies energy to form and sustain it The
energy required to form and sustain a cyclone comes from the heat of condensation of water vapour
present in moist air rising from the surface of hot sea water This will become clear from the following
discussion We know that water absorbs heat and changes into water vapour This absorbed heat gets
stored in water vapour Now when water vapour gets cooled and condenses to form liquid water it
releases the stored heat This is called the heat of condensation of water vapour A cyclone is powered by
the heat of condensation of water vapour present in the warm high moisture air which rises from the
warm sea surface and condenses at high altitudes to form clouds The seawater becomes warm because
it is heated by the suns heat rays It is the warm seawater which provides heat continuously for the
evaporation of water to form water vapour Let us now discuss the cyclone in detail

124

CYCLONE

A cyclone is a huge revolving storm caused by very high speed winds blowing around a central area
of very low pressure in the atmosphere A cyclone is formed over
warm seawater and it is about 10 to 15 kilometres high A cyclone
revolves due to the force exerted by the rotation of earth The centre
of a cyclone is a calm area having very low air pressure The
centre of cyclone is called the eye of the cyclone see Figure 16
The diameter of the eye of cyclone varies from 10 to 30 kilometres
The eye of cyclone is a region free of clouds and it has only light
winds Around the calm and clear eye of cyclone there is a cloud
region of about 150 kilometres in size In this region there are very
high speed winds having speeds of 150 kmh to 250 kmh which
are moving in circles around the eye and thick thunderclouds
which produce heavy rain Away from this region of clouds the
wind speed gradually decreases A cyclone is known as
chakkravaat or bavandar in Hindi We will now describe the
formation of a cyclone

How a Cyclone is Formed
Figure 16 A satellite picture of cyclone This
A cyclone is formed in the atmosphere over warm seawater picture shows how a cyclone appears when
near the equator during the hottest summer months Factors like viewed from a satellite high above the earth
temperature humidity wind speed wind direction and rotation The eye of cyclone can be seen at the centre
of earth contribute to the development of a cyclone The The spiral cloud bands formed by swirling
winds are emanating outwards
formation of a cyclone can be explained as follows
i The sun heats the seawater too much during summer Warm and moist air rises up very rapidly
from the hot sea surface This creates area of very low pressure causing cool air to rush in to fill the vacant
space
ii As the warm and moist air containing a lot of water vapour rises high up in the atmosphere it
gets cooled and the water vapour present in it condenses to form thick clouds called thunderclouds
releasing a lot of heat in the atmosphere
iii The heat released by the condensation of water vapour in the atmosphere warms the air all around
This warm air rises higher into the
Spiralling winds
atmosphere causing a low pressure More
air rushes up to take the place of warm
rising air This process is repeated again
Cool dense air
and again making more and more air to rise
up higher and higher in the atmosphere
and also forming more and more thick
clouds or thunderclouds all around
iv The constant rotation of earth on its
Thick
Thick
clouds
axis exerts a force on the rapidly rising clouds
columns of air or winds The force exerted
by the rotation of earth makes the high
speed winds revolve in the form of a spiral
Warm moist air
moving upwards with a great force and
create a tunnel of very low pressure inside
it within the thunderclouds see Figure

condition consisting of a system of high speed winds revolving around a central area of very low pressure is the
cyclone The area of very low pressure at the centre of the cyclone is its eye see Figure 17
Once a cyclone is formed it begins to move over the surface of sea It is sustained by a steady flow of
warm and moist air from the warm seawater The strongest winds and the heaviest rains occur in the
towering thunderclouds about 20 to 30 kilometres from the centre of the cyclone The end of a cyclone
comes quickly if a cyclone moves over land because it no longer receives heat energy and moisture from
warm seawater A cyclone is known by different names in different parts of the world For example a
cyclone is called hurricane in the American continent A cyclone is called typhoon in Japan and
Philippines

Destruction Caused by Cyclones
Cyclones are the greatest storms on earth Cyclones can be
very destructive Cyclones cause widespread destruction and loss of
life in coastal areas in three ways  by producing extremely high speed
winds by lifting the seawater several metres high  and by bringing
torrential rains This is discussed below
i The cyclones bring with them extremely high speed
winds which cause a lot of destruction The tremendous force of
high speed winds accompanying a cyclone can topple trees
electric poles telephone poles and vehicles damage houses
and hurl people through air etc causing a great loss of life
and property see Figure 18 The strong winds of cyclone
produce powerful water waves in the sea and push sea water
towards the shore even if the cyclone is hundreds of kilometres Figure 18 Destruction caused by a cyclone
away
ii The extremely low pressure in the eye of cyclone
lifts the water surface of the sea upwards to a height of 3
to 12 metres The rising sea water appears like a waterwall moving towards the shore see Figure 19 This
waterwall coming from the sea rushes inland with deadly
force and causes widespread flooding of lowlying coastal
areas The fast moving flood waters brought in by a
cyclone destroy roads and railway tracks wash away
vehicles damage houses drown people and animals
and damage crops causing a great loss of life and
property The floods caused by cyclone also reduce the
fertility of soil in the cyclone hit areas This is because the
Figure 19 Cyclone causes sea water to rise and
fertile top soil is washed away by flood waters brought in
flood coastal areas
by cyclone
iii Cyclones bring with them torrential rains The continuous heavy rains brought by cyclones may
further worsen the flood situation in the area This increases the problems of the cyclone affected people
iv The floods caused by cyclones pollute drinking water sources Drinking of polluted water spreads
waterborne diseases like typhoid and dysentery These diseases kill more people in the cyclone affected
areas
The part of land adjoining the sea or near the sea is called coast or coastal area The length of coast
is called coastline The whole coastline of India is vulnerable to cyclones This means that the whole
coastline of India is exposed to being hit by cyclones The east coast of India is more vulnerable to
cyclones or cyclonic storms The west coast of India is less vulnerable to cyclones or cyclonic storms
both in terms of intensity and frequency of cyclones All the places cities and villages in India which lie

126
in the coastal areas are likely to be affected by cylones For example the places like Chennai Mangaluru
Mangalore and Puri are likely to be affected by cyclones because they are coastal areas which lie near the
sea On the other hand those places which are far away from the sea are unlikely to be affected by
cyclones For example Delhi Amritsar and Srinagar are far away from the sea so they are unlikely to be
affected by cyclones which originate in the sea
In our country Orissa was hit by a cyclone on 18th October 1999 This cyclone had a wind speed of
200 kmh It destroyed 45000 houses making 700000 people homeless Many people were killed Another
cyclone hit Orissa on 29th October the same year It had a wind speed of 260 kmh This cyclone was
accompanied by water waves about 9 metres high Thousands of people lost their lives Property worth
crores of rupees was destroyed The cyclone affected electricity supply communication systems transport
and agriculture

Effective Safety Measures By the Government
The following safety measures should be taken by the Government for the people living in cyclone
prone coastal areas to prevent cyclone related disasters
i Cyclone shelters should be constructed in cyclone prone coastal areas Cyclone shelters are strong
buildings usually built on pillars which can withstand high speed cyclone winds and where
cyclones flood water cannot enter
ii An efficient cyclone forecast and warning service is essential to prevent cyclone related disasters
iii The cyclone warning should be communicated rapidly to the concerned Government agencies ports
ships fishermen and general public living in coastal areas through radio television telephones
newspapers and other means
iv Government vehicles such as buses trucks etc should be kept ready to evacuate people likely to
be affected by cyclone from their homes and move them fast to safer places such as cyclone
shelters

Action on the Part of People Before a Cyclone Hits Their Area
The following advance planning is required by the people living in the cyclone prone coastal areas if
a cyclone warning has been issued in their area
i Do not ignore the cyclone warnings issued by the Meteorological Department through newspapers
radio or television
ii Make necessary arrangements to shift the essential household goods and domestic animals etc to
safer places
iii Keep ready the telephone numbers of all the emergency services like police fire brigade and
hospitals
iv Remain in a state of preparedness to evacuate at short notice when asked to do so by the authorities
Precautions to be Taken After the Cyclone Hits an Area
If a person lives in an area which has just been hit by a cyclone the following precautions should be
observed
i Do not drink water that could be contaminated by floods to avoid waterborne diseases Drink only
clean water which has been stored for emergencies
ii Do not touch wet electric switches and fallen electric power lines Do not use electrical appliances if
wet
iii Do not enter damaged buildings or flood waters Avoid driving on roads through standing water as
floods may have damaged the roads
iv Do not go out just for the sake of fun Keep listening to local radio for advice Go out only when it is
safe to do so

127
v Do not pressurise the rescue teams by making unnecessary demands Cooperate with the rescue
teams and help your neighbours and friends
Advanced Technology Has Helped in Protection From Cyclones
In the early part of the last century the available technology was not able to detect the approaching
cyclone much in advance In those days the people living in coastal areas had less than a day to prepare
and evacuate their homes to protect themselves from an oncoming cyclone The situation today is very
different Due to advances in technology we now have satellites and radars By making use of satellites
and radars a cyclone alert or cyclone watch is now issued 48 hours in advance of any expected storm
and a cyclone warning is issued 24 hours in advance This gives sufficient time to people to prepare and
evacuate The cyclone related message is broadcast over radio every hour or half hour when a cyclone is
nearer the coast Thus advanced technology has helped in giving us better protection from cyclones

A tornado is a violent storm with a column of rapidly rotating
winds having the appearance of a dark funnelshaped cloud that
reaches from the sky to the ground see Figure 20 Most of the tornadoes
form from thunderstorms Before a tornado starts large thunderclouds
appear in the sky One area of the thundercloud becomes specially dark
and dense The air in this area is rotating quickly A funnelshaped cloud
begins to form and extend downwards to the ground see Figure 20 The
diameter of the narrow end of a tornado which touches the ground can
be as small as a metre and as large as a kilometre or even more Due to
very low pressure in it the funnel of a tornado sucks dust debris and
everything else including people and vehicles near its base and throws
them out near the top A tornado moves across the surface of land or sea
producing very high speed winds A violent tornado can travel at speeds
of about 300 kmh Most of the tornadoes are weak Tornadoes are not
very frequent in our country

TORNADO

Figure 20 A tornado

Destruction Caused by Tornadoes
The wind speed in a tornado may reach up to 300 kilometres per hour Tornadoes cause much damage
from the sheer force of its high speed winds A tornado causes considerable damage as it passes over land
This happens as follows
i Tornado uproots trees electric poles and telephone poles disrupting power supply and
telecommunications
ii Tornado lifts people and vehicles off the ground and hurls them hundreds of metres away This
causes death of many people and damage to vehicles
iii Tornado can cause extensive damage to buildings When a tornado passes over a building it sucks
up air from around the building This makes the pressure on
the outside of the building much lower than that on the inside
and the building can explode
Protection from a Tornado
The following precautions should be taken for protection during
a tornado
i Take shelter in a room situated deep inside the house having
no windows or in a basement underground room This is the
best tornado shelter

Figure 21 Protecting head and neck
from falling debris during a tornado

128
ii If a room without windows or basement is not available then shut all the doors and windows of the
house and take shelter under a sturdy table where falling debris cannot reach Bend down on your
knees and protect your head and neck using your arms see Figure 21 Stay indoors until it is safe
to come out

CHAPTER

Soil

9

he uppermost layer of earths crust in which plants grow is called soil see picture above Soil is
a dark brown or black solid material which is a mixture of rock particles of various sizes and
decayed plant and animal matter called humus Soil also contains air water and countless living
organisms Some of the living organisms which are present in the soil are bacteria fungi insects such as
ants and beetles worms like earthworms rodents moles and plant roots Many of the living organisms
present in soil are too small to be seen with naked eyes Thus soil is the home for many living organisms
Soil is called mitti in Hindi Soil is an important part of land We can see soil all around us
Soil is one of the most important natural resources In fact soil is essential for the existence of life on
the earth It is in the soil that the plants and trees grow Soil supports the growth of plants and trees by
holding their roots firmly and by supplying them with water and nutrients If there were no soil on the
earth there could be no grass no crop plants no trees and hence no food for us or other land animals
Thus soil is essential for agriculture Agriculture provides us food clothing and shelter housing Some
of the important uses of soil are given below
1 Soil is used for growing food like grains pulses fruits and vegetables etc
2 Soil is used to grow trees for obtaining wood for building purposes timber for burning as fuel
firewood and for making paper
3 Soil is used to grow cotton plants which give us cotton clothes Soil is also used to grow mulberry
trees for rearing silkworms which provide us silk for making silk clothes
4 Soil is used to make bricks and mortar for building houses
5 Soil is used to make earthenware or pottery such as matkas surahis etc crockery cups and plates
toys and statues etc
Before we describe how soil is formed we should know the meaning of the terms weathering and
humus The process by which huge rocks are broken down into small particles by the action of suns
heat wind rain and flowing river water etc is called weathering It is called weathering because the
rocks are worn away to form small particles by long exposure to the elements of weather such as heat

132

133
wind rain etc Weathering of rocks is a very very slow process It takes thousands of years to weather
huge rocks or break down huge rocks into fine particles fit to make soil When plants and animals die
their bodies decompose in nature to form organic matter The organic matter formed by the
decomposition of dead plants and animals by the microorganisms like certain bacteria and fungi is
called humus Humus contains nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus etc which are needed by the
plants for their growth Keeping these points in mind we can now describe how soil is formed
How Soil is Formed
Soil is formed from rocks by the process of weathering In weathering rocks are broken down very
slowly by the action of suns heat wind rain flowing river water etc to form tiny rock particles These
tiny rock particles then mix up with humus to form fertile soil The nature of any soil depends on the rocks
from which it has been formed and the type of vegetation that grows in it

SOIL PROFILE

Topsoil

First
layer

If we look carefully on the sides of a trench made by digging soil from the surface of earth downwards
we will find that the soil consists of three different layers A vertical section or cutting through the soil
showing the different layers of soil is called soil profile In most simple words the side view of dug up
soil is called soil profile Soil profile consists of three different layers of soil Each layer of soil is called a
horizon The three layers of soil in the soil profile are
1 Ahorizon or Topsoil
2 Bhorizon or Subsoil
3 Chorizon or Substratum
The soil profile consisting of three different layers of soil is shown in Figure 1 Each layer of soil

Figure 1 Soil profile

differs in depth colour texture feel and chemical composition We will now describe all the three layers
of soil in detail one by one
1 AHorizon or TopSoil
The top layer of soil is called Ahorizon see Figure 1 The top layer of soil is also called topsoil Topsoil is dark in colour This is because topsoil is rich in minerals and humus The plant roots grow in the
topsoil The topsoil contains many living things For example topsoil is the home of many living
organisms like insects such as ants and beetles worms such as earthworms rodents and moles etc
Bacteria and fungi also occur in topsoil Topsoil contains a lot of decayed dead plants and animal remains
In other words topsoil contains a lot of humus This humus makes the topsoil very fertile The topsoil
is soft and porous and can hold more of water The topsoil is rich in minerals which the plants need for
growth In fact the plants get all the essential nutrients from the topsoil Topsoil is the most useful part
of the soil

2 BHorizon or SubSoil
The layer of soil which is just below the topsoil is called Bhorizon see Figure 1 It is also known
as subsoil The subsoil is made up of slightly bigger rock particles than that of topsoil It is somewhat
harder and more compact than the topsoil Subsoil is also lighter in colour than the topsoil The subsoil
contains very little living organisms The roots of some of the trees are however able to reach subsoil
The subsoil has very little humus decayed organic matter Due to this subsoil is much less fertile as
compared to the topsoil Subsoil is however rich in soluble minerals

3 CHorizon or SubStratum
The layer of soil which is just below the subsoil is called Chorizon see Figure 1 It is also called
substratum Substratum is made up of small lumps of broken rocks or stones formed by the partial
weathering of bedrock or parent rock In other words we can say that substratum consists of partially
weathered rocks In the substratum part of soil the rock pieces are still breaking down to form smaller and
smaller particles
Below the Chorizon we have unweathered solid rock called bedrock or parent rock see Figure 1
It is this bedrock or parent rock which has produced the soil over a long period of time
We usually see the top surface of the soil not the layers below it We can however see the soil profile
at a place showing the inner layers of soil in the following situations
i Soil profile can be seen by looking at the sides of a recently dug trench or ditch
ii Soil profile can be seen while digging a well or foundation of a building
iii Soil profile can be seen at the sides of a road on the hill or a steep river bank
All these situations give us a side view of soil which tells us that soil consists of three different layers
Wind temperature rainfall light and humidity are some important climatic factors which affect the soil
profile and bring changes in the soil structure
The most important part of soil for us is the topsoil So we will discuss the top soil in detail Please
note that in the following discussion when we talk of soil it will actually mean topsoil which is the most
fertile soil We will now discuss the composition of soil

COMPOSITION OF SOIL
The soil is mainly made up of different sized rock particles and humus In addition to their other
functions the rock particles present in soil also provide mineral salts needed for plant growth Air water
and living organisms are also essential components of a fertile soil Thus the soil is made up of six
components  Rock particles of different sizes Minerals Humus Organic matter Air Water and
Living organisms The rock particles present in soil are of different sizes and chemical compositions On
the basis of their sizes the rock particles present in soil can be divided mainly into four groups  Clay
Silt Sand and Gravel These are described on the next page

135

i The smallest rock particles present in soil form clay Thus clay has the smallest sized rock
particles in it Since the size of clay particles is very small we cannot see single clay particles Because of
its very small particles clay feels smooth to touch Clay is known as chikni mitti in Hindi
ii The rock particles in soil which are a little larger than clay particles form silt Thus silt is made
up of rock particles somewhat bigger than that of clay Due to its slightly bigger sized particles silt is not
so smooth Actually the size of silt particles is inbetween that of clay and sand The size of silt particles is
bigger than that of clay particles but smaller than those of sand particles Silt occurs as a deposit in river
beds Floods in rivers deposit the silt from rivers in the fields Silt is known as gaad in Hindi
iii The rock particles in soil which are larger than silt particles form sand Thus sand is made up
of particles larger than that of silt Being quite large sand particles can be easily seen by us And because
of its large sized particles sand is coarse to touch Sand is called reit or balu in Hindi
iv The largest sized rock particles present in soil are called gravel Gravel is a kind of tiny stones
The amount of gravel present in a good topsoil is very small Gravel is known as kankad or bajri in Hindi
We will now describe an activity to show that soil consists mainly of rock particles of different sizes
and humus

ACTIVITY TO SHOW THAT SOIL CONSISTS MAINLY OF ROCK PARTICLES OF
DIFFERENT SIZES AND HUMUS

We take a tall gas jar and fill it threefourths with water Add about 200 grams of soil into the water in
the gas jar Stir the contents of the gas jar with a glass rod to mix
the soil and water completely Allow the gas jar to stand
Humus
undisturbed until the soil has settled into different layers see Figure
2
If we look carefully at Figure 2 we will find that the rock
Water
particles present in the sample of soil settle at the bottom of the gas
jar The rock particles of different sizes form different layers in the
gas jar on the basis of their density or heaviness The largest
particles present in the soil called gravel being heaviest form a
layer at the bottom of the gas jar see Figure 2 The sand particles
Clay
being lighter than gravel form a layer above the gravel The silt
Silt
particles being still lighter form a layer above the sand particles
Rock
particles
And clay particles being the lightest rock particles form a layer
Sand
above the silt see Figure 2 The humus present in soil is lighter
Gravel
than water so humus floats on the surface of water in the gas jar
see Figure 2
Figure 2 Soil consists mainly of rock
From this activity we conclude that the soil is made up mainly particles clay silt sand and gravel of
of the rock particles like clay silt sand and gravel and humus In different sizes and humus
other words the major components of soil are rock particles and humus
We have just studied that in a good topsoil gravel is present in very small amount This means that
the main rock particles present in the topsoil are sand clay and silt Now the soils in different
geographical areas contain different proportions of sand clay and silt in them They also contain different
amounts of humus In other words the soils in different geographical areas will be different in
compositions So depending on its composition a soil can be classified as sandy soil clayey soil or
loamy soil All these soils have different proportions of rock particles of different sizes The sizes of rock
particles in a soil have a very important influence on the properties of that soil We will now discuss the
various types of soils in detail

136

TYPES OF SOIL
There are mainly three basic types of soils These are  Sandy soil Clayey soil and Loamy soil The
differences in the compositions of these three types of soil and their properties are discussed below

1 Sandy Soil
Sandy soil contains mainly sand having large particles with large spaces see Figure 3 It has
hardly any clay or silt in it Sandy soil contains very little humus Sandy soil is found in desert areas
Sandy soil has large particles with large spaces between them
A disadvantage of sandy soil is that it cannot hold much water
in it because the water gets drained out quickly through large
spaces between its particles So sandy soil dries out quickly
which is not good for plants Sandy soil however provides
good aeration air to the plant roots and it can be ploughed
very easily Sandy soil is light It has a tendency to blow away
if left bare Sandy soil is less fertile The fertility of sandy soil
can be increased by adding humus to it in the form of manure
Humus improves the waterholding capacity of sandy soil and
also supplies it necessary plant nutrients Sandy soil is not
Figure 3 Sandy soil
sticky Due to this sandy soil cannot be used to make pots like
matkas and surahis etc bricks toys and statues

2 Clayey Soil
Clayey soil contains mainly clay having very small particles with very small spaces see Figure 4
It has hardly any sand or silt in it Clayey soil also contains very little humus Clayey soil has very good
waterholding capacity due to its very small and tightly packed particles
Clayey soil is heavy because it can hold more water than the sandy soil
The smallness of particles of clayey soil is also a disadvantage This is
because the water drains out very slowly through clayey soil which can
lead to waterlogging of soil and damage the crop plants Moreover due
to the smallness of its pores clayey soil is not able to trap enough air for
the roots of the plants Clayey soil is compact and sticky due to which the
ploughing of clayey soil is quite difficult Clayey soil is however rich in
minerals which is good for the growth of plants Clayey soil is more
fertile than sandy soil The fertility of clayey soil can be improved by
adding some sand and humus manure to it Sand will improve the
drainage of clayey soil whereas humus will provide it the necessary plant
nutrients Clayey soil is very sticky Due to this clayey soil is used to
Figure 4 Clayey soil
make pots like matkas and surahis etc bricks toys and statues In fact
clayey soil is the best soil for making pots bricks toys and statues
3 Loamy Soil
Loamy soil is a mixture of sand clay silt and humus in the right proportions Loamy soil is a
mixture of large and small rock particles which impart it the desired properties For example loamy soil
has the right waterholding capacity for the growth of plants The excess water can also drain out through
it easily Loamy soil has also adequate air spaces between its particles to hold sufficient air needed by plant
roots Loamy soil can also be ploughed easily Loamy soil contains sufficient amount of humus So loamy
soil has all the necessary nutrients for the growth of plants Loamy soil is the most fertile soil It is the best
soil for growing crops Loamy soil is also known as just loam
From the above discussion we conclude that soils are classified on the basis of the relative proportions
of rock particles of various sizes

137
i If the soil contains greater proportion of big particles it is called sandy soil
ii If the soil contains greater proportion of fine particles it is called clayey soil
iii If the soil contains about the same proportions of large and fine particles then it is called loamy soil
or loam
Differences Between Sandy Soil and Clayey Soil
The main differences between sandy soil and clayey soil are given below
i Sandy soil contains mainly big rock particles whereas clayey soil contains mainly fine rock particles
ii Sandy soil cannot hold much water but clayey soil has very good waterholding capacity
iii Sandy soil provides good aeration air to plant roots but clayey soil is not able to trap enough air
for the roots of plants
iv Sandy soil is loose light and nonsticky whereas clayey soil is compact  heavy and sticky

v Sandy soil is less fertile whereas clayey soil is comparatively more fertile

SOILS AND CROPS

Different types of soils are found in different parts of India In some parts of India there is clayey soil
in some parts there is loamy soil whereas in other parts there is sandy soil Soil is affected by the climatic
factors such as wind rainfall temperature light and humidity The climatic factors as well as the type of
soil determine the type of crops and other vegetation which can grow in a region Different types of crops
grow well in different types of soils Some of the important crops and the types of soils which are suitable
for growing these crops are given below

i Clayey soil and loamy soil are both suitable for growing cereals like wheat and gram chana Such
soils are good at retaining water The best soil for growing wheat crop is however loamy soil This
is because loamy soil is rich in humus and very fertile

ii Soil rich in clay and organic matter and having very good capacity to retain water is ideal for
growing paddy rice crop

iii For growing lentil masoor dal and other pulses loamy soil which drains water easily is required

iv For growing cotton crop sandyloam soil which drains water easily and can hold plenty of air in
it is more suitable

PROPERTIES OF SOIL

Some of the important properties or characteristics of soil are as follows
1 Soil contains air

2 Soil contains water or moisture
3 Soil can absorb water or soak up water
4 Soil allows water to percolate or pass down through it
We will now perform some activities to study all these properties of soil one by one

SOIL CONTAINS AIR
Air is present in the spaces between the soil particles This air provides the oxygen required for
respiration by the roots of plants and other organisms which live in soil The presence of air in the soil can
be shown by performing a simple activity as follows

138

ACTIVITY
We take some dry soil in a beaker Add water to the beaker and
stir the soil and water with a glass rod for a while We will see the
bubbles coming out of the soil see Figure 5 These bubbles are of the
air which was present in spaces between the soil particles Actually
when we stir the soil with water then water enters the spaces
between the soil particles and expels the air present there This
expelled air is seen in the form of bubbles coming out from the soil
So this activity shows that soil contains air

Sand particles are quite large Sand particles cannot fit closely
Figure 5 Activity to show that the soil
together so there are large spaces between sand particles The large
contains air
spaces between sand particles are filled with air Due to this sandy
soil provides much more air to the plant roots On the other hand
clay particles being much smaller pack tightly together leaving little space for air So clayey soil provides
much less air to the plant roots which grow in it

SOIL CONTAINS WATER OR MOISTURE

Soil always contains some water in it which is called soil moisture Water is usually present as a thin
film around the soil particles It is absorbed by the roots of the plants The capacity of a soil to hold water
is important for the growth of various crops Even a dry looking soil has some water or moisture in it The
presence of water or moisture in the soil can be shown by performing an activity as follows

ACTIVITY

We take some dry soil in a hard glass beaker and cover it with a lid
such as a watch glass Heat the beaker by using a burner We will see that
tiny drops of water are formed on the inner side of the lid see Figure 6 This
shows that even the soil which appears to be dry to us contains some water
Actually there is an invisible film of water around the soil particles When
soil is heated then water present in it evaporates forming hot water vapour
or steam This hot water vapour rises gets cooled and condenses on the
cold inner surface of the lid to form drops of liquid water see Figure 6

The presence of water or moisture in the soil leads to an interesting
phenomenon which can be easily observed by us If we pass through a
farmland during a hot summer day we will see that the air above the soil Figure 6 Activity to show that
is shimmering shining with a slightly shaking light This happens as soil contains water or moisture
follows  The soil in the farmland contains some water On a hot summer
day this water of soil evaporates to form water vapour The water vapour coming out of the soil reflects
the sunlight irregularly due to which the air above the soil seems to shimmer
To Find the Percentage of Water or Moisture in a Soil
We will now describe an activity to find out the water content or moisture content in a given sample
of soil It is found in terms of percentage which means water present in 100 grams of a soil This can be
done as follows

ACTIVITY
i Take some soil and weigh it on a balance This will give us the original mass of soil taken
ii Place this soil on a newspaper and keep it in bright sunshine to dry Allow the soil sample to dry for
about two hours After drying weigh the soil again on a balance This will give us the mass of dry soil

139
iii Subtract the mass of dry soil from the original mass of soil The difference in the mass of soil before
and after drying will give us the mass of water or moisture present in the original mass of soil taken
The percentage of water or moisture in the given sample of soil can then be calculated by using the
formula
Percentage of water in soil

Mass of water in soil
 100
Original mass of soil

The calculation of water content in a given sample of soil will become clear from the following
example
Sample Problem 200 grams of a soil is taken and dried completely in bright sunshine The mass of
dried soil is found to be 170 grams Calculate the percentage of water or moisture present in the given
sample of the soil
Solution In this case
Original mass of soil  200 g
g  gram
Mass of dried soil  170 g
So
Mass of water in soil  200  170
 30 g
We know that
Mass of water in soil

Thus the given sample of soil contains 15 per cent water in it We can also say that the given sample
of soil contains 15 per cent moisture in it By saying that a soil contains 15 per cent water we mean that
100 grams of this soil contains 15 grams of water

SOIL CAN ABSORB WATER

Though soil usually contains some water or moisture it can still absorb or soak up a lot of water
Absorption is called sokhna in Hindi The absorption of water by soil will become clear from the following
activity

ACTIVITY

Let us take two testtubes and fill equal amounts of water in them Pour water from one testtube on the
cemented floor in the house We will find that the water poured on the cemented floor flows down it is not
absorbed by the cemented floor Let us now pour water from the second testtube on the soil kept in a flower
pot We will see that the soil absorbs the water quite rapidly Now cemented floor does not absorb water
because it is not porous The soil absorbs water because it is porous having tiny pores in it All types of
soils however do not absorb water to the same extent Some soils absorb more water whereas other soils
absorb less water
To Find the Percentage of Water Absorbed by a Soil
We will now describe an activity to find out the percentage of water absorbed by a given sample of
soil By saying the percentage of water absorbed by a soil we mean the mass of water absorbed by 100
grams of a soil Let us describe the activity now

140

ACTIVITY

i Take a filter paper fold it properly and fix it in a plastic funnel Keep the funnel having filter paper fixed
in it in a beaker as shown in Figure 7
ii Take some dry powdered soil and weigh it on a balance This will give us the mass of soil taken Pour
this weighed soil into the filter paper fixed in the funnel see Figure 7
iii Fill a measuring cylinder with water and
note the initial volume of water taken in the
measuring cylinder Take out water from the
measuring cylinder with the help of a dropper and
pour it drop by drop on the soil kept in the funnel
All the water should not fall at one spot on the soil
The water should be poured uniformly all over the
soil
iv Keep pouring water in the soil kept on filter
paper till it just starts dripping from the lower end
of the funnel see Figure 7 Then stop pouring more
water on soil The dripping of water from funnel
tells us that the soil taken on the filter paper has
absorbed the maximum amount of water Note the
final volume of water left unused in the measuring
cylinder
v Subtract the volume of water left in the
Figure 7 Activity to find the percentage of water absorbed
measuring cylinder from the initial volume of water
by a soil
taken in the measuring cylinder This difference will
give us the volume of water absorbed by the soil taken on filter paper in the funnel
By using the above observations the percentage of water absorbed by the soil can be calculated as
follows
Suppose
Mass of soil taken  m grams
Read as  vone mL
Read as  vtwo mL

Initial volume of water  v1 mL
taken in measuring cylinder
Final volume of water  v2 mL
left in measuring cylinder

Volume of water absorbed  v1  v2 mL
by soil
Now it is known that 1 mL volume of water has a mass equal to 1 gram So we can also say that
Mass of water absorbed  v1  v2 grams
by soil
So

Mass of water absorbed

Mass of soil taken

Percentage of water absorbed  1 2  100
where

Percentage of water absorbed

v2  Final volume of water

m  mass of soil taken

141

The calculation of percentage of water absorbed by a given sample of soil will become clear from the
following example
Sample Problem 100 mL of water was taken in a measuring cylinder This water was added dropwise
to 50 g of dry soil kept on filter paper in a funnel When the water just started dripping from the soil in the
funnel the amount of water left in the measuring cylinder was found to be 80 mL Calculate the percentage
of water absorbed by this soil
Solution Here
Initial volume of water v1  100 mL
Final volume of water v2  80 mL
And
Mass of soil taken m  50 g
Now we know the formula
v  v
Percentage of water absorbed  1 2  100

 40 per cent
Thus the percentage of water absorbed by this soil is 40 per cent This means that 100 grams of this
soil can absorb a maximum of 40 grams of water in it

SOIL ALLOWS WATER TO PERCOLATE

Soil is a porous solid substance having tiny pores in it When water is poured over soil then some of
it gets absorbed in the soil and the rest passes down the soil The process in which water passes down
slowly through the soil is called percolation of water Percolation is called risna in Hindi Though water
can percolate through all types of soils but the rate of percolation of water through different types of soils
is different The rate of percolation of water tells us how fast water passes down the soil Please note that
whether we call rate of percolation of water or percolation rate of water it means the same thing

To Measure the Percolation Rate of Water in Soil
The percolation rate of water in a soil is the volume of water in millilitres which passes down the
soil per minute The percolation rate of water in a soil can be measured as follows
ACTIVITY
i Take a 20 cm long PVC pipe having a diameter of
about 5 cm At the place where percolation rate of water is
to be measured dig the soil to a depth of about 2 cm in the
ground Place one end of the pipe in the dug up ground and
hold it vertically see Figure 8 Fill a measuring cylinder
with water Note the volume of water taken in the
measuring cylinder
ii Pour the water taken in the measuring cylinder in the
pipe slowly from the top end as shown in Figure 8 Note
the time when you just start pouring water in the pipe
iii After some time all the water poured in the pipe
will percolate down through the soil leaving the pipe empty
Note the time again when all the water has percolated down
through the soil and the pipe becomes empty
iv The difference in the two time readings will give us
the time taken by the water taken in the measuring cylinder
Figure 8 Activity to measure percolation rate of
to percolate into the soil
water in a soil

142
The percolation rate of water in the soil can be calculated by using the formula
Percolation rate of water in soil

Volume of water percolated in soil
Time taken for percolation

The volume of water percolated in soil is measured in millilitres mL and the time taken is measured
in minutes min So the percolation rate of water is expressed in the unit of millilitres per minute
which is written in short form as mLmin The calculation of percolation rate of water in soil will become
clear from the following example
Sample Problem 200 mL of water takes 40 minutes to percolate completely in a particular soil
Calculate the percolation rate of water in this soil
Solution Here Volume of water percolated  200 mL
And
Time taken for percolation  40 min
Now we know the formula

Volume of water percolated
Time taken for percolation

200 mL
40 min
 5 mLmin

Percolation rate

Percolation rate

Thus the percolation rate of water in this soil is 5 millilitres per minute By saying that the percolation
rate of water in this soil is 5 millilitres per minute we mean that 5 millilitres of water passes down this soil
every one minute
Sandy soil is quite loose so the percolation rate of water is highest in sandy soil On the other hand
clayey soil is very compact So the percolation rate of water is lowest in the clayey soil It has been found
that 8 to 10 days after the rains the level of water in a well rises The sandy soil having the highest
percolation rate allows the rainwater to reach a well faster and in greater amount Also since sandy soil
has the highest percolation rate it retains the least rainwater in it On the other hand the clayey soil having
the lowest percolation rate retains the highest amount of rainwater in it
In rainwater harvesting more rainwater is made to percolate into the soil by digging percolation pits
We have already studied rainwater harvesting in Class VI Paddy rice crop is planted in standing water
in the fields Paddy also requires a lot of irrigation water afterwards The soil with a low percolation rate
of water would be the most suitable for growing paddy rice crop because it will allow the water to
remain in the fields for a much longer time
Before we discuss soil erosion we should know the meaning of the term vegetation All the plants
growing on the surface of earth are called vegetation Vegetation includes green grass herbs shrubs
bushes crop plants as well as trees It is the fertile topsoil of the earth which makes the vegetation grow
Vegetation covers the soil like a green sheet spread on the surface of earth Another point to be noted is
that extreme scarcity or extreme shortage of food is called famine We will now discuss soil erosion

SOIL EROSION
The topsoil is very fertile This topsoil is often carried away by strong winds or washed away by
heavy rains The removal of fertile topsoil from land by wind or water is called soil erosion see Figure
9 The loss of fertile top soil at a place exposes the infertile subsoil which cannot be used to grow plants
and trees And in the absence of plants and trees the area becomes a desert In desert soil erosion occurs
mainly through the wind

143

b The cutting down of forest trees has
allowed the rainwater to wash away
top soil
Figure 9 Soil erosion

a The top soil in dry fields is being carried
away by strong wind

Soil erosion does not occur easily where the land is covered by vegetation trees and other plants
Soil erosion occurs easily in those areas of land which are not covered by vegetation trees and other
plants or have very little vegetation Thus soil erosion is more severe in areas such as bare land or
deserts We will now describe why the soil covered by vegetation is not eroded easily but the soil not
covered by vegetation or bare soil is eroded very easily
1 If there is vegetation trees and other plants on land then the roots of vegetation trees and other
plants growing in the soil bind the particles of topsoil firmly Due to the binding of soil particles by the
roots of trees and plants the blowing wind and flowing rainwater are not able to carry away topsoil and
hence soil erosion does not occur On the other hand the soil not covered by vegetation trees and other
plants is easily eroded because there are no roots of trees and plants in it which can bind the soil particles
together and prevent them from being carried away by strong winds or flowing rainwater Actually in the
absence of plant roots the soil becomes loose
2 If there is vegetation trees and other plants on land then much of the falling rain hits the trees and
plants before it hits the soil In this way the cover of vegetation softens or reduces the effect of heavy rains
on the soil The soil does not become loose easily and the flowing rainwater is not able to carry away topsoil Due to this soil erosion does not occur If however there is no vegetation trees and other plants on
land to soften the effect of heavy rains the bare soil becomes loose quickly by the force of falling rainwater
and erodes easily This is because being loose it is easily carried away by flowing rainwater or strong
winds
Cause of Soil Erosion
Soil erosion is caused mainly by the large scale cutting down of forest trees and other plants which
is called deforestation A large number of forest trees are cut down everyday for obtaining wood for
burning as fuel firewood for building purposes timber and for the manufacture of paper When the
forest trees and other plants are cut down then the top soil gets exposed and becomes loose because there
are no roots to bind soil and no cover to soften the effect of falling rain Blowing wind and flowing
rainwater can then carry away this loose soil easily causing soil erosion
Effects of Soil Erosion
The important effects of soil erosion are as follows
1 Soil erosion can turn lush green forests into deserts and spoil the environment When the fertile
topsoil in a forest gets removed by soil erosion then the infertile subsoil is left behind No forest plants
can grow in this remaining infertile soil due to which the once lush green forest can gradually turn into a
desert This spoils our environment

144
2 Soil erosion can lead to famines excessive scarcity of food When the fertile topsoil is removed
by soil erosion then the food crops do not grow well in the remaining infertile soil And due to bad crops
there is an excessive shortage of foodgrains in that area The people do not get sufficient food to eat and
this leads to starvation deaths
3 Soil erosion can cause floods The soil carried away from land by the flowing rainwater gradually
deposits on river beds decreasing their depth So when it rains heavily the river cannot take away all the
rainwater quickly Due to this river water overflows from its banks and causes severe floods by
submerging surrounding areas These floods cause damage to life and property

Prevention of Soil Erosion
Soil is a very important natural resource in which our food is grown So we should protect soil by
preventing its erosion Soil erosion can be prevented in the following ways
1 Soil erosion can be prevented by preventing large scale cutting down of forest trees The large
scale cutting down of forest trees is called deforestation So
we can also say that soil erosion can be prevented by
preventing deforestation
2 Soil erosion can be prevented by afforestation large
scale growing of forest trees in place of cut down trees If
the trees have to be cut down from the forests for various
needs then new trees should be planted in place of the cut
down trees see Figure 10 In this way the forests will
continue to have sufficient number of trees all the time And
this tree cover will prevent soil erosion of the forest land
Figure 10 A forest being replanted to prevent
3 Soil erosion can be prevented by increasing the
soil erosion
green cover vegetation around us by planting more trees
and plants ourselves

SOIL POLLUTION

The contamination of soil with waste materials especially used polythene bags and plastics
pesticides fertilisers acid rain and industrial chemical wastes etc is called soil pollution The various
sources of soil pollution and their effects are as follows
1 Dumping of waste materials such as polythene bags
plastics glass and metal objects causes soil pollution see
Figure 11 Some waste materials like paper and vegetable
wastes rot after some time and become harmless But the waste
materials such as polythene bags and other plastics plastic
bottles etc do not rot on their own and remain as such
indefinitely So polythene bags and plastics pollute the soil They
also kill the living organisms For example if the cattle like
cow eats up the polythene bags alongwith the thrown food it
may even die There is a demand to ban polythene bags and plastics
because they cause soil pollution and may also kill the living
organisms The used glass and metal objects also do not rot in Figure 11 Dumping of waste materials causes
nature and cause soil pollution
soil pollution
2 The use of pesticides in agriculture causes soil
pollution Pesticides are the poisonous chemical substances which are sprayed on standing crops to save
them from the harmful insects and diseases Some of these pesticides also mix up with the soil in the fields
and pollute it So the grains fruits and vegetables grown in this polluted soil contain pesticides When we

145
eat such contaminated grains fruits or vegetables the pesticides present in them enter our bodies and
damage our health in the long run
3 The excessive use of fertilisers in agriculture causes soil pollution Chemical fertilisers are added
to soil in the fields to increase food production The excessive use of chemical fertilisers makes the soil
highly acidic or alkaline When the soil becomes highly acidic or alkaline it is said to be polluted This soil
becomes unfit for the growth of crop plants
4 Acid rain causes soil pollution Acid rain makes the soil highly acidic This acidic soil becomes toxic
or poisonous for plant growth In this way pollution caused by acid rain makes the soil less fertile
5 Dumping of industrial wastes causes soil pollution Many industries or factories dump their
waste products containing harmful chemicals on soil These chemicals cause soil pollution and harm the
plants which grow in it and the cattle which graze on it

Respiration in
Organisms

e need energy to walk run climb the stairs wash clothes and cook food Even when we are
talking eating reading writing or sleeping energy is required The processes like digestion of
food beating of heart and movement of ribs and diaphragm during breathing etc which take
place inside our body also need energy for their working In fact we need energy to perform all the
activities which maintain our life and also to do work We get this energy from the food which we eat
The food has stored energy The stored energy of food is released slowly during the process of
respiration which takes place inside our body all the time even when we are sleeping It is this energy
which is then utilised in carrying out various life processes and doing our work Respiration is essential
because it provides us energy from the food which we eat and digest So all the living organisms need to
respire to get energy from food required for their survival Many times we see our parents insisting that
we should eat food regularly This is because food is like a fuel for our body which provides us energy to
maintain our life and stay healthy It is not only the human beings who need energy All other animals and
plants also require energy We will now discuss the process of respiration and how it provides energy to
human beings other animals as well as plants

RESPIRATION
All the organisms plants and animals require energy for performing various activities and
maintaining their life This energy is obtained by the breakdown of digested food during the process of
respiration The process of releasing energy from food is called respiration Respiration occurs in all the
living cells The process of respiration involves taking in oxygen of air into the cells using it for
releasing energy by burning food and then eliminating the waste products carbon dioxide and water
from the body Most living things need oxygen of air to obtain energy from food This oxygen reacts with
149

150
the food like glucose present in the body cells and burns them slowly to release energy This energy is
used by the living things The process of respiration can be written in the form of a word equation as
follows
Glucose

Food

Oxygen
From air

Respiration

in body cells

Carbon dioxide  Water  Energy
Glucose

Oxygen

During respiration the energyrich food like glucose is broken down Food
From air
by oxygen into carbon dioxide and water and energy is released see
Figure 1 This energy is used up by the organism plant or animal In fact
respiration is a kind of slow burning or slow combustion of food at
ordinary temperature to produce energy During respiration oxygen is
taken in and carbon dioxide is given out Thus the process of respiration
Cell
involves the exchange of gases  oxygen and carbon dioxide The process of
respiration is the reverse of photosynthesis This is because photosynthesis is the making of food like glucose by absorbing sunlight energy
whereas respiration is the breaking of food like glucose to release energy
Energy
There are two main parts in the process of respiration
i Breathing taking in oxygen from air and releasing carbon dioxide
Carbon dioxide
Water
Figure 1 Respiration takes
ii Using oxygen in the cells of the organism for releasing energy from
place
in every cell in our body
food like glucose
and those of other organisms
The air which we breathe in is transported to all the parts of the body
and ultimately to each cell of the body In the cells oxygen of air brings about the breakdown of glucose
food The process of breakdown of food in the cells of the body with the release of energy is called
respiration Since the process of respiration which releases energy from food takes place inside the cells of
the body it is also called cellular respiration The process of cellular respiration is common to all the living
organisms humans other animals as well as plants It takes place in all the cells of an organism

AEROBIC AND ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION

Respiration usually takes place in the presence of oxygen of air Respiration can however also take
place in the absence of oxygen of air though it is very rare This means that the breakdown of food like
glucose to release energy can occur in the presence of oxygen as well as in the absence of oxygen Based on
this there are two types of respiration  aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration These two types of
respiration are discussed below
1 Aerobic Respiration
The respiration which uses oxygen is called aerobic respiration In other words when the breakdown
of glucose food occurs with the use of oxygen it is called aerobic respiration It is called aerobic
respiration because it uses air which contains oxygen aerobic means with air In aerobic respiration the
glucose food is completely broken down into carbon dioxide and water with the use of oxygen and energy
is released The breaking down of food during aerobic respiration can be represented by means of a word
equation as follows
Glucose
Food

Oxygen

Aerobic respiration

Carbon dioxide

Water

Energy

The energy released during aerobic respiration is used by the organism Most of the living organisms
carry out aerobic respiration by using oxygen of air For example humans man dogs see Figure 2
cats lions elephants cows buffaloes goat deer birds lizards snakes earthworms frogs fish and insects

151
such as cockroach grasshopper houseflies mosquitoes and ants etc
and most of the plants carry out aerobic respiration by using oxygen of
air to obtain energy All the organisms which obtain energy by aerobic
respiration cannot live without the oxygen of air This is because if
there is no oxygen they cannot get energy from the food which they eat
Aerobic respiration produces much more energy because complete
breakdown of glucose food occurs during aerobic respiration by the use
of oxygen The complete breakdown of glucose food produces carbon
dioxide and water

Food

No oxygen

Anaerobic respiration in yeast

Figure 2 The dog obtains energy
2 Anaerobic Respiration
The respiration which takes place without using oxygen is called from its food through aerobic
respiration by using oxygen of air
anaerobic respiration In other words when the breakdown of glucose
food occurs without the use of oxygen it is called anaerobic
respiration It is called anaerobic respiration because it takes place without air which contains oxygen
anaerobic means without air The microscopic organisms like yeast and certain bacteria obtain energy
by anaerobic respiration In anaerobic respiration the microorganisms like yeast break down glucose
food in the absence of oxygen to form alcohol and carbon dioxide and release energy The breaking down
of glucose food during anaerobic respiration carried out by yeast can be represented by writing a word
equation as follows

The energy produced in this anaerobic respiration is
used by the yeast Only a few living organisms carry out
anaerobic respiration to obtain energy without using
oxygen of air For example yeast see Figure 3 and
certain bacteria carry out anaerobic respiration in the
absence of oxygen to obtain energy All the organisms
which obtain energy by anaerobic respiration can live
without the oxygen of air For example yeast is an
organism which can live without the oxygen of air because
it obtains energy by the process of anaerobic respiration
Figure 3 Yeast singlecelled fungus obtains energy
Those organisms which obtain energy by the process of through anaerobic respiration without using oxygen
anaerobic respiration without using oxygen are called of air This picture shows a large number of yeast
anaerobes Thus yeast is an anaerobe Yeast can survive in cells
the absence of oxygen
Yeast is a singlecelled organism Actually yeast is a singlecelled fungus In yeast a single cell
represents the whole organism Yeast is used to make alcoholic drinks such as wine and beer and bread
This happens as follows Yeast respires anaerobically and during this process yeast converts glucose into
alcohol Yeast is therefore used in industry to make alcohol This alcohol is used in making wine and beer
Anaerobic respiration in yeast also produces carbon dioxide gas In breadmaking the carbon dioxide
produced by yeast makes the bread rise Thus anaerobic respiration in yeast is used to make alcohol wine
beer etc and bread Anaerobic respiration as in yeast produces much less energy because only partial
breakdown of glucose food occurs in anaerobic respiration in the absence of oxygen The products of this
partial breakdown of glucose food are alcohol and carbon dioxide
Anaerobic Respiration in Muscles
We human beings normally obtain energy by aerobic respiration But under certain conditions when

152

Energy

Please note that during heavy physical exercise or
any other hard work most of the energy is produced by
aerobic respiration Anaerobic respiration in muscles
provides only some extra energy which is needed under
these circumstances see Figure 4 Please note that
anaerobic respiration does not take place only in the
muscles of human beings it also takes place in the
muscles of other animals such as lions tigers deer etc
when they run very fast and require much more energy
than normal

Lactic acid

Anaerobic respiration in muscles

Glucose

extra energy is needed anaerobic respiration can take place in our muscles for a short time When the
oxygen gets used up faster in our muscle cells than can be supplied by the blood then a temporary
deficiency of oxygen occurs in the muscle cells For example when we do a heavy physical exercise fast
running cycling or weightlifting etc our muscles need a lot of energy To produce more energy our
muscles need more oxygen But the supply of oxygen through blood is limited and hence insufficient
Under these conditions anaerobic respiration takes place in the muscle cells without oxygen to produce
extra energy and fulfil the demand for more energy Thus anaerobic respiration takes place in our muscle
cells during any vigorous physical activity when oxygen gets used up faster in the muscle cells than can
be supplied by the blood
When anaerobic respiration takes place in our muscle cells in the absence of oxygen then glucose
food breaks down partially to form lactic acid and releases some energy This extra energy helps us in
doing hard physical exercise The breaking down of glucose food during anaerobic respiration in muscles
to release energy can be represented by a word equation as follows

After a heavy physical exercise very fast running
etc we sometimes get muscle cramps Painful
contractions of muscles are called cramps see the man Figure 4 During vigorous physical exercise such as
on right side in Figure 4 This can be explained as running fast leg muscles respire anaerobically
without oxygen to produce extra energy
follows  During heavy exercise some of our muscles
respire anaerobically The anaerobic respiration by muscles brings about partial breakdown of glucose
food to form lactic acid This lactic acid accumulates in the muscles The accumulation of lactic acid in
the muscles causes muscle cramps Thus muscle cramps occur due to the accumulation of lactic acid in
muscles when the muscles respire anaerobically without oxygen while doing hard physical exercise We
can get relief from cramps in muscles caused by heavy exercise by taking a hot water bath or a massage
Hot water bath or massage improves the circulation of blood in the muscles Due to improved blood flow
the supply of oxygen to the muscles increases This oxygen breaks down lactic acid accumulated in muscles
into carbon dioxide and water and hence gives us relief from cramps Before we end this discussion we
would like to give the main points of similarities as well as differences between aerobic respiration and
anaerobic respiration These are given below
Similarities Between Aerobic and Anaerobic Respiration
Aerobic respiration

Anaerobic respiration

1 In aerobic respiration energy is produced
by the breakdown of food like glucose
2 Aerobic respiration takes place in the
cells of the organism

1 In anaerobic respiration also energy is
produced by the breakdown of food like glucose
2 Anaerobic respiration also takes place
in the cells of the organism

153
Differences Between Aerobic and Anaerobic Respiration
Aerobic respiration

Anaerobic respiration

1 Aerobic respiration takes place in the
presence of oxygen
2 Complete breakdown of food occurs
in aerobic respiration
3 The end products in aerobic respiration
are carbon dioxide and water

1 Anaerobic respiration takes place in the absence
of oxygen
2 Partial breakdown of food occurs in anaerobic
respiration
3 The end products in anaerobic respiration may
be alcohol and carbon dioxide as in yeast
or lactic acid as in muscles
4 Much less energy is produced in anaerobic
respiration

4 Aerobic respiration produces a considerable
amount of energy

BREATHING

We can live without food and water for many days but we cannot live for more than a few minutes
without air This is because air is necessary for breathing During breathing we take air into our lungs
through the nose and then expel it The ordinary air which we
take into the lungs is rich in oxygen but the air expelled from the
lungs is rich in carbon dioxide We can now define breathing as
follows  Breathing is the process by which air rich in oxygen is
taken inside the body of an organism and air rich in carbon
dioxide is expelled from the body with the help of breathing
organs Different organisms have different organs for breathing
depending on their structure and oxygen requirements The
breathing in human beings takes place through the organs called
lungs see Figure 5
The taking in of air rich in oxygen into the body during
breathing is called inhalation and giving out or expelling the air
rich in carbon dioxide is called exhalation Both inhalation and
exhalation take place regularly during breathing A breath means Figure 5 Human beings breathe through
one inhalation plus one exhalation We know that air contains their lungs
oxygen So when we breathe in air it is actually the oxygen gas present in air which is utilised by our body
to break down food and produce energy Thus we breathe in air to supply oxygen to the cells of our
body for the breakdown of food to release energy and we breathe out to remove waste product carbon
dioxide from our body which is produced during the breakdown of
food in the cells
We normally breathe air through our nose or sometimes even
through the mouth Now if we close our nostrils and mouth
tightly we soon start feeling uneasy and cannot hold our breath
even for one minute  see Figure 6 This shows how essential
breathing of air is to keep us alive And when we release the breath
after holding it for some time we have to breathe deeply This deep
breathing is to supply the extra oxygen to our body to make up for
the oxygen which was not available during the time we held our
breath Breathing is a continuous process which goes on all the
time and throughout our life and that of other animals as well as
plants The mountaineers carry oxygen cylinders with them for Figure 6 We cannot hold our breath for a
breathing because the amount of air available to a person for long time because breathing in air is
breathing at high altitude is much less than that available on the essential to remain alive
ground

154

Breathing Rate
We have just learnt that a breath means one inhalation plus one exhalation The number of times a
person breathes in one minute is called breathing rate On an average an adult human being at rest
breathes in and out 15 to 18 times in a minute So the average breathing rate in an adult human being at
rest is 1518 times per minute Women breathe slightly faster than men Breathing rate of a person is not
constant always The breathing rate of a person changes according to the oxygen requirements of the body
For example the breathing rate of a person is the slowest
when he is sleeping because minimum energy is required by
the body during sleep which can be provided by a slow rate
of breathing The breathing rate of a person increases with
increased physical activity like exercise running
weightlifting etc see Figure 7 When the breathing rate
increases greater amount of air goes into the lungs With
more air going into the lungs the blood can absorb oxygen at
a faster rate Thus faster breathing supplies more oxygen to
the body cells for producing more energy by the rapid
breakdown of food needed for doing heavy physical
exercise etc During heavy physical exercise the breathing
rate of an adult human being can increase up to 25 per
minute or even more For example if a person runs a
distance his breathing rate increases Running makes a person Figure 7 The breathing rate of a weightlifter
breathe faster because the faster breathing rate supplies more oxygen increases too much during weightlifting so as to
supply oxygen rapidly for the speedy breakdown
to the body cells for the speedy breakdown of food for releasing more of food to provide extra energy required for
energy required for running When we run or do some other lifting heavy weights
physical exercise not only do we breathe faster we also take
deep breaths so as to inhale more air and get more oxygen for the speedy release of energy from food It
is a common observation that an athlete breathes faster and deeper than usual even after finishing a race
This is because during the race the leg muscles of athlete have produced extra energy by doing anaerobic
respiration without using oxygen By breathing faster and deeper the athlete is giving back oxygen to the
muscles which it could not give earlier at the time of running due to lack of oxygen at that time
Please note that whenever a person needs extra energy he breathes faster than usual Due to faster
breathing oxygen is supplied to our body cells at a faster rate The faster supply of oxygen increases the
speed of breakdown of food due to which more energy is released rapidly It is a common observation that
we feel hungry after doing a heavy physical exercise or any other heavy physical activity This is
because to provide extra energy for doing heavy physical exercise the food has broken down very rapidly
by faster breathing and made us feel hungry Another point to be noted is that the breathing rate in
children is higher than that of adults Children breathe about 20 to 30 times per minute
How Do We Breathe
We will now learn the mechanism of breathing That is  we will now learn how air from outside is
sucked into our lungs during inhaling breathing in and how air from our lungs is pushed out during
exhaling breathing out The process of breathing takes place in our lungs Lungs are connected to our
nostrils holes in the nose through nasal passage or nasal cavity and windpipe When we inhale air it
enters our nostrils  passes through nasal passage and windpipe and reaches our lungs Our two lungs
hang in an airtight space in our body called chest cavity Around the sides of the chest cavity is the rib
cage with sheets of muscles between the ribs The rib cage encloses the lungs in it see Figure 8a At the
bottom of the chest cavity is a curved sheet of muscle called diaphragm see Figure 8a Diaphragm forms
the floor of chest cavity Breathing involves the movements of the rib cage and the diaphragm This
happens as follows

155

a Breathing in When we breathe in or inhale then two things happen at the same time  i the
muscles between the ribs contract causing the rib cage to move upward and outward and ii the diaphragm
contracts and moves downward see Figure 8a The upward and outward movement of rib cage as well
as the downward movement of diaphragm both increase the space in the chest cavity and make it larger see
Figure 8a As the chest cavity becomes larger air is sucked in from outside into the lungs The lungs
get filled up with air and expand

a Breathing in  chest cavity becomes
bigger air is sucked into lungs

b Breathing out  chest cavity becomes
smaller air is pushed out of lungs

Figure 8 The mechanism of breathing

b Breathing out When we breathe out or exhale even then two things happen at the same time
i the muscles between the ribs relax causing the rib cage to move downward and inward and ii the
diaphragm relaxes and moves upward see Figure 8b The downward and inward movement of rib cage
as well as the upward movement of diaphragm both decrease the space in our chest cavity and make it smaller
see Figure 8b As the chest cavity becomes smaller air is pushed out from the lungs
The process of breathing in of air and breathing out goes on continuously all day and all night The
breathing movements in our body can be felt easily as follows  Place one hand on the middle of your
chest and the other hand on the abdomen as shown in Figure 9 Take a few deep breaths and release
them We can feel the up and down movements of our chest and abdomen caused by breathing in and
breathing out of air If we observe carefully we can also see the up and down movements of the
abdomens of animals such as cows dogs and cats etc as they breathe

Figure 9 Feeling breathing movements
in our body

Figure 10 Measuring the chest size

156
The size of our chest increases during the process of breathing in of air because the chest cavity becomes
bigger Different people can expand their chest by different amounts We can measure the maximum
expansion in the chest size as follows  First measure the size of chest with a measuring tape while holding
the breath after exhaling normally see Figure 10 Then take a very deep breath so as to cause maximum
expansion in chest hold the breath for a while and measure the size of the chest in this expanded position
The difference in the two readings of the measuring tape will give the maximum expansion in the size of the
chest which can be brought about by us

ACTIVITY TO DEMONSTRATE THE MECHANISM OF BREATHING

We can demonstrate the mechanism of breathing by performing a simple activity as follows  The
apparatus required for this activity is shown in Figure 11a A big bell jar B is taken The bell jar is a glass
jar whose bottom is open A glass tube T branching into two smaller tubes at its lower end is fitted in the
mouth of the bell jar with the help of a cork Two balloons are tied at the two ends of the tube T as shown
in Figure 11a A thin rubber sheet S is tied around the open bottom of the bell jar In this apparatus the
space inside the bell jar represents the chest cavity the balloons represent the lungs whereas the rubber sheet
represents the diaphragm

i In order to show the process of breathing in air we pull the rubber sheet downwards see Figure
11b In this case the space in the bell jar increases lowering the air pressure inside the bell jar The air from
outside rushes in through the tube T into balloons due to which the balloons get inflated their size increases
see Figure 11b This shows the action of diaphragm during inhaling of air
ii In order to show the process of breathing out of air we release the rubber sheet see Figure 11c
In this case the space in the bell jar decreases The air from inside the balloons goes out through the tube T
due to which the balloons get deflated their size decreases see Figure 11c This shows the action of
diaphragm during exhaling of air
The action of rubber sheet in this activity shows how we inhale and exhale air during breathing with
the help of the downward and upward movement of diaphragm in our body When the diaphragm moves
downward during inhaling the lungs get filled with air But when the diaphragm moves upward during
exhaling then the air is forced to go out of the lungs This activity however does not show the action of rib
cage during breathing

157

What Happens to the Air Which We Breathe During Respiration
The air which we breathe in from the atmosphere is called inhaled air and the air which we breathe
out from our lungs through nose or mouth is called exhaled air We know that air is a mixture of gases
such as nitrogen oxygen carbon dioxide and water vapour etc Now the air which we breathe in is a
mixture of gases and the air which we breathe out is also a mixture of gases The only difference in the
inhaled air and exhaled air is that they contain different proportions of oxygen carbon dioxide and
water vapour The proportion of nitrogen gas in the inhaled air and exhaled air remains the same 78 per
cent because it is neither used up in respiration nor produced during respiration We will now discuss
what causes changes in the proportions of oxygen carbon dioxide and water vapour in the inhaled air and
exhaled air
i The Case of Oxygen The air which we inhale contains a higher proportion of oxygen Now some of
the oxygen of inhaled air is used up in breaking down glucose food during respiration So the exhaled air which
comes out after the process of respiration contains a lower proportion of oxygen Thus exhaled air contains
less oxygen than inhaled air
ii The Case of Carbon Dioxide The air which we inhale contains a lower proportion of carbon
dioxide Now during respiration when oxygen breaks down glucose food then some carbon dioxide is produced So
the exhaled air that comes out after the process of respiration contains a higher proportion of carbon
dioxide Thus exhaled air contains more carbon dioxide than inhaled air
iii The Case of Water Vapour The air which we inhale contains only a little of water vapour When
glucose food is broken down by oxygen during respiration then water is also produced alongwith carbon
dioxide So the exhaled air contains a lot more water vapour than inhaled air
From the above discussion we conclude that during the process of respiration when glucose food is
broken down to release energy then some of the oxygen of inhaled air is used up whereas carbon dioxide
and water are produced This is why the exhaled air contains less of oxygen but more of carbon dioxide
and more of water vapour The amount of oxygen carbon dioxide and water vapour in inhaled air and
exhaled air is given below
Inhaled Air
Exhaled Air
Oxygen

Carbon dioxide  004

Water vapour

Water vapour
 A lot
It is a common observation that if we exhale air on a mirror through our mouth then a patch of
moisture is formed on the mirror surface This is because the exhaled air coming from our mouth contains
a lot of water vapour This water vapour condenses on the mirror surface to form tiny droplets of water
which appear as a patch of moisture We will now describe an activity to show that carbon dioxide gas is
formed during the process of respiration in our body

ACTIVITY TO SHOW THAT CARBON DIOXIDE IS PRODUCED DURING
RESPIRATION
We know that carbon dioxide gas turns limewater milky The fact that carbon dioxide is produced
during respiration can be shown by demonstrating the effect of inhaled air and exhaled air on limewater
The apparatus to demonstrate the effect of inhaled air and exhaled air on limewater is shown in Figure 12
The apparatus consists of two boiling tubes A and B fitted with twoholed corks The boiling tubes A and B
are connected through a special type of glass tube C The left arm of glass tube C is short which goes in the
boiling tube A The right arm of glass tube C is long and dips in lime water in boiling tube B see Figure 12
The boiling tube A has another bent glass tube D whose longer side dips in limewater contained in it The
boiling tube B has also another short bent tube E in it which does not dip in limewater

158

Figure 12 Testing inhaled air and exhaled air for carbon dioxide

To perform the activity we put the top end of the tube C in mouth and breathe in and breathe out
gently When we breathe in then the inhaled air fresh air enters the glass tube D and passes through the
limewater in boiling tube A And when we breathe out then the exhaled air coming from our lungs passes
through the limewater in boiling tube B We continue to breathe in and breathe out for about five minutes
We will find that the limewater in boiling tube A in which inhaled air is passed turns milky only slightly
but the limewater in boiling tube B in which exhaled air is passed turns milky appreciably This shows that
less carbon dioxide is present in inhaled air but much more carbon dioxide is present in exhaled air From
this observation we conclude that carbon dioxide is produced during respiration which comes out in exhaled air

RESPIRATION IN HUMANS

We have already studied that the process of digestion in human beings produces energyrich simple
compounds like glucose The digested food glucose is carried to all the cells of our body by the blood
circulatory system The human beings obtain energy from the digested food glucose by the process of
respiration which takes place in every cell In human beings many organs take part in the process of
respiration We call them organs of respiratory system The main organs of human respiratory system are
Nose Nasal passages Passages in the nose Trachea Bronchi Lungs and Diaphragm The human
respiratory system is shown in Figure 13
Our nose has two holes which are called nostrils see Figure 13 There is a passage in the nose behind
the nostrils This is called nasal passage or nasal cavity The nasal passage joins the nostrils to the trachea
see Figure 13 The trachea is a tube which is also called windpipe The upper end of trachea has a voice
box called larynx The trachea or windpipe branches into two smaller tubes called bronchi at its lower
end see Figure 13 The singular of bronchi is bronchus The two bronchi are connected to the two lungs
one to the left lung and other to the right lung see Figure 13
Each bronchus divides in the lungs to form a large number of still smaller tubes called bronchioles
The smallest bronchioles have tiny airsacs at their ends see Figure 13 The pouchlike airsacs at the ends
of the smallest bronchioles are called alveoli The walls of alveoli are very thin and they are surrounded
by very thin blood capillaries The exchange of gases between the air and blood takes place across the walls
of the alveoli

Rib cage

Figure 13 The human respiratory system

The diaphragm is a curved sheet of muscle below the lungs The breathing organs of human beings
are lungs Our lungs lie in the chest cavity which is bound by the rib cage and diaphragm The muscles of
rib cage and diaphragm help in breathing in and breathing out
When we breathe in and out our chest goes up and down or heaves This happens as follows  When
we breathe in air our chest cavity expands This expansion movement of the chest cavity helps in sucking
in air containing oxygen in it On the other hand when we breathe out air then the chest cavity
contracts This contraction movement of the chest cavity helps in squeezing out carbon dioxide from the
walls of the lungs and expelling it from the body We will now describe the working of respiratory system
in human beings
We normally breathe in air containing oxygen through the nose The air enters the nostrils passes
through the nasal passage larynx trachea bronchi and finally reaches the lungs see Figure 13 In the
lungs air passes through a large number of small tubes called bronchioles and then reaches the tiny airsacs
called alveoli The alveoli are surrounded by very thin blood vessels called capillaries which carry blood
in them The oxygen of air diffuses out from the alveoli into the blood in the capillaries The blood carries
oxygen to all the parts of the body This oxygen is carried by a red pigment called haemoglobin present
in the red blood cells
As blood passes through the tissues of the body the oxygen present in it diffuses into the cells This
oxygen combines with the digested food glucose present in cells to release energy The materials like fatty
acids and glycerol produced by the digestion of fats are also oxidised during respiration to produce
energy Carbon dioxide and water are produced by the oxidation of food during respiration The waste
products of respiration carbon dioxide and water enter into blood Blood carries the carbon dioxide and
water to the alevoli in the lungs From the lungs carbon dioxide and water vapour are removed with the

160
air we breathe out In this way the process of gaseous exchange is completed in the human respiratory
system

Sneezing
The sudden expulsion of air from the nose without our control over it due to the irritation of nasal
passage is called sneezing see Figure 14 We often sneeze when we
inhale air containing dust smoke or pollen etc This happens as follows
The air around us sometimes contains various types of small unwanted
particles such as dust smoke pollens etc Now there are some very fine
hair inside our nose in the nasal passage or nasal cavity When we inhale
air the unwanted particles present in air usually get trapped in the hair
present in our nasal passage Sometimes however the particles of dust
smoke and pollens etc present in inhaled air get past the hair in the nasal
passage and irritate the lining of nasal passage as a result of which we
sneeze Sneezing expels all the unwanted particles from the inhaled air so
that a dust free clean air enters into our lungs see Figure 14 Please note
that whenever we sneeze we should cover our nose properly with a
Figure 14 Sneezing
handkerchief so that the unwanted particles which we expel during
sneezing are not inhaled by other persons nearby us

Figure 15 Yawning

Yawning
The action of opening ones mouth wide while taking a long and
deep breath of air without any control over it is called yawning see
Figure 15 Yawning is called jambhai or ubasi in Hindi A person yawns
when he is tired bored stressed overworked feeling sleepy or drowsy
There are many theories about why people yawn According to one
theory yawning is caused by insufficient oxygen in the body This is
said to happen as follows  When we are tired bored stressed overworked feel sleepy or drowsy we do not breathe as deeply as we
normally do and hence our breathing rate slows down Due to slower
breathing rate less oxygen of air goes into our body which is insufficient
for respiration production of energy Yawning helps in bringing more
oxygen into our blood because during yawning our mouth opens wide
and we take a long and deep breath of air

Smoking
The lungs are very delicate organs which are essential for breathing and keeping us alive The biggest
enemy of our lungs is the habit of smoking
Smoking tobacco in the form of beedi cigarette or
cigar damages our lungs gradually and causes ill
health Smoking sends tobacco smoke inside the
body The chemicals present in tobacco smoke
damage the lungs in many ways Some of the
harmful effects of smoking are as follows
i Smoking destroys the lung tissue gradually
due to which breathing becomes very
a These are the lungs of a
difficult
nonsmoker healthy man
ii Smoking causes lung cancer see Figure 16
iii Smoking causes heart diseases

b These are the lungs of a
man who died of lung
cancer due to heavy
smoking
Figure 16 Smoking is injurious to health

161
iv Smoking also damages the health of nonsmokers who inhale the air containing tobacco smoke
Smoking kills Many people die every year from diseases caused by smoking The bad habit of
smoking must be avoided to lead a healthy life

BREATHING AND RESPIRATION IN OTHER ANIMALS

We have just studied that the breathing organs of human beings are lungs Just like human beings the
animals such as cows buffaloes dogs cats lions goats deer elephants frogs lizards snakes and birds
also have lungs for breathing So the process of breathing and respiration in these animals is similar to that
in humans There are however a large number of animals which do not have lungs for breathing Some
of the animals which do not have lungs for breathing are earthworm fish cockroach grasshopper
mosquitoes houseflies and ants The animals such as cockroach grasshopper mosquito housefly and ant
are called insects So we can also say that insects do not have lungs for breathing We will now describe the
process of breathing and respiration in earthworm fish and insects such as cockroach and grasshopper
etc which do not have lungs

1 Breathing in Earthworm

Figure 17 The earthworm breathes
through its thin and moist skin

The earthworm breathes through its skin see Figure 17 The skin of earthworm is quite thin and
moist Gases can easily pass through the skin of earthworm The skin of earthworm has a good blood

Figure 18 The frog breathes through
the lungs as well as through skin

supply So the earthworm absorbs the oxygen of air needed for respiration through its thin and moist
skin This oxygen is then transported to all the cells of the earthworm by its blood where it is used in
respiration production of energy The carbon dioxide produced during respiration is carried back by the
blood This carbon dioxide is expelled from the body of the earthworm through its skin Thus in earthworm
the exchange of gases takes place through the thin and moist skin Frogs live on land as well as in water Though
frogs have lungs for breathing they can also breathe through their moist skin Thus frog is an animal
which can breathe through lungs as well as its moist skin see Figure 18
2 Breathing in Fish
There are many animals which live in water The animals living under water have gills for
breathing Gills are the organs which help the animals living in water to use oxygen dissolved in water for
breathing Gills are projections of the skin Gills have blood
vessels for the exchange of respiratory gases oxygen and carbon
Gill
dioxide
cover
Fish lives in water The fish has special organs of
breathing called gills The gills help the fish to use oxygen
which is dissolved in water in which it lives The fish has gills
on both the sides of its head see Figure 19 The gills are
covered by gill covers so they are not visible from outside For
breathing the fish uses the oxygen which is dissolved in water
This happens as follows  The fish breathes by taking in water
through its mouth and sending it over the gills see Figure 19
Figure 19 Breathing organs in fish are gills

162
When water passes over the gills the gills extract dissolved oxygen from this water The extracted oxygen
is absorbed by the blood and carried to all the parts of the fish for respiration release of energy The
carbon dioxide produced during respiration is brought back by the blood into the gills for expelling into
the surrounding water The fish has no lungs like us the exchange of gases in fish takes place in the gills Some
other aquatic animals like prawn crab and fresh water mussel also respire through gills or similar
structures
Most of the snails live in water and have gills for breathing They use gills to extract oxygen dissolved
in water Some of the snails who live on land have developed a kind of lung So the land snails breathe by
using the lung There are however some seaanimals like dolphins and whales which live in water but
do not have gills Dolphins and whales breathe in air through their nostrils called blowholes which are
located on the upper parts of their heads Dolphins and whales come to the surface of seawater from time
to time to breathe in air We human beings cannot survive under water because we have no gills to make use of
oxygen dissolved in water for breathing We have to take along oxygen gas cylinder for breathing under water

3 Breathing in Insects
All the insects have tiny holes on the sides of their body which are called spiracles see Figure 20

Insect
Grasshopper

Tracheae

Spiracles

Figure 20 An insect breathes through tiny holes called spiracles and thin airtubes called tracheae

The spiracles on the body of insects are connected to a network of thin airtubes called tracheae which
spread into the whole body of the insect The singular of tracheae is trachea The breathing in all the
insects takes place through tiny holes called spiracles and thin airtubes called tracheae This happens
as follows  Air rich in oxygen enters into the insect through spiracles by the up and down movements of
its body This air goes into the network of thin airtubes called tracheae From the tracheae oxygen of air
diffuses into the body tissues of insect and reaches each and every cell of its body where it is utilised in
respiration production of energy Carbon dioxide produced during respiration in the cells diffuses into
tracheae and carried to the spiracles where it is expelled in the process of breathing Thus in insects the
exchange of gases occurs through tracheae
The spiracles tiny holes and tracheae airtubes are found only in insects and not in any other group
of animals For example cockroach is an insect so a cockroach has spiracles tiny holes on the sides of
its body and tracheae airtubes throughout inside its body for the process of breathing and respiration
The insects such as grasshoppers mosquitoes houseflies bees and wasps also have spiracles and tracheae
for breathing and respiration
Please note that insects have blood in their body but it is not red because it does not contain
haemoglobin Since the blood of insects does not contain haemoglobin so it cannot carry oxygen to all the
parts of the body Every part of the body of an insect gets oxygen through a network of big and small airtubes

RESPIRATION IN PLANTS
Like animals plants also need energy The plants get energy by the process of respiration in which
glucose food prepared by them breaks down in the presence of oxygen of air to form carbon dioxide

163

1 Respiration in Leaves
The leaves of plants have tiny pores on their surface which are called
stomata see Figure 21 The exchange of gases oxygen and carbon dioxide
in the leaves during respiration takes place through stomata This happens
as follows  Oxygen from air enters into a leaf through stomata and reaches
all the cells by the process of diffusion This oxygen is used in respiration in
the cells of the leaf The carbon dioxide produced during respiration diffuses
out from the leaf into air through the same stomata So we can also say that the
plants breathe through the tiny pores in their leaves called stomata

and water with the release of energy This energy is used by the plant for carrying out its various life
processes Thus like other living organisms plants also respire for their survival Plants take oxygen from
air for respiration and give out carbon dioxide So just like animals respiration in plants also involves the
exchange of gases  oxygen and carbon dioxide The respiration in plants differs from that of animals in that in
plants each part like leaves roots etc can carry out respiration independently In other words in plants
each part can independently take in oxygen from air utilise it to obtain energy and give out carbon
dioxide We will now describe the respiration in the leaves and roots of a plant one by one

2 Respiration in Roots
Figure 21 Stomata in the leaf
The roots of a plant are under the ground but root cells also need oxygen
of a plant
to carry out respiration and release energy for their own use The roots obtain
oxygen for breathing and respiration from the soil as follows  Air is present inbetween the particles of soil
see Figure 22 The roots of a plant take up air from the spaces between the soil particles Actually the
roots of a plant have a very large number of tiny hair on them
which are called root hair The root hair are in contact with the
Ground
Root
air in the soil particles see Figure 22 Oxygen from air in soil
level
particles diffuses into root hair and reaches all the cells of the
root where it is utilised in respiration Carbon dioxide produced
Soil
particles
in the cells of the root during respiration goes out through the
same root hair by the process of diffusion Thus the respiration
in roots occurs by the exchange of gases oxygen and carbon
spaces
dioxide through the root hair If a potted plant is overwatered
Root
hair
for a long time then the plant may ultimately die This is because
too much water expels all the air from inbetween the soil
particles Due to this oxygen is not available to the roots for
aerobic respiration Under these conditions the roots of plant
respire anaerobically producing alcohol This may kill the plant
Figure 22 Roots absorb oxygen from air
Please note that plants carry out photosynthesis for present inbetween the soil particles through
the root hair
making food only during the day time when sunlight is
available On the other hand plants carry out respiration to obtain energy during the day time as well
as at night because they require energy all the time We will now answer a question based on respiration
taken from the NCERT book
Sample Problem Three testtubes are taken and labelled A B and C Each testtube is half filled with
water
a In testtube A a snail is kept
b In testtube B a water plant is kept and
c In testtube C a snail and a water plant both are kept
The three testtubes are then placed in sunlight Which testtube would have the highest concentration
of carbon dioxide  Why

164
Answer a Testtube A contains a snail in water The snail will use up oxygen for respiration and
produce carbon dioxide
b Testtube B contains a water plant in water The water plant will do photosynthesis by using
carbon dioxide and water and produce oxygen The water plant will use some of this oxygen for
respiration and produce carbon dioxide This carbon dioxide will then be used by the plant in
photosynthesis
c Testtube C contains both a snail and a water plant The carbon dioxide produced by the respiration
in snail will be all used up by the water plant in photosynthesis
From the above discussion we conclude that the testtube A containing only snail will have the highest
concentration of carbon dioxide because there is no plant to use up the carbon dioxide produced during the
respiration in snail
We are now in a position to answer the following questions
