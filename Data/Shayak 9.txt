Changes Around Us:
5 Physical and Chemical

I placed a cube of ice
here half an hour ago.
It has now become
water!

A bud that I saw
yesterday on this rose
plant has become a
ﬂower today.

The bottle containing
cold water is not cold
anymore.

Yesterday, I saw some
brown spots on a
banana, but today it
has more brown spots
and a strong smell.

These students are describing some changes. What kinds of
changes are they talking about?

You might have noticed that these changes could be in the size,

think of some other changes that happen in your surroundings?
Make a list of those changes too.
We observe the changes occurring around us with the help of
our senses of sight, smell, touch, hearing, and taste.

Can we arrange these
changes into categories?

Let us try to answer this question.

5.1 A Substance May Change in
Appearance but Remain the Same!
Activity 5.2: Let us create and discuss
A. Creating some objects with paper
 Take a few sheets of paper
and fold them to create
new objects (Fig. 5.1).
 Do you get the same paper
back when you unfold
these objects?
B. Playing with a balloon
 Take a balloon and inﬂate
it. Now, loosen your grip
and let the air escape out.

Caution — Be careful while using a pin.

 What happens? Will you be able to get the uninﬂated
balloon back?
C. Crushing a piece of chalk
 Crush a small piece of chalk into powder.
 Can you get the chalk piece back from the powder?
Is there any similarity in the changes listed in A, B, and C?
During all these changes, materials, such as the paper, the
rubber sheet of the balloon, and the chalk, remained the same,
though their appearances (shape or size) may have changed. You
may also recall from the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity that
water can exist in diﬀerent states (solid, liquid, and gas), and can
change from one state to another.
In all these cases, although we observe a change in the
appearance, no new substance is formed. Such changes in which
only physical properties like shape, size, and state of substances
change are called physical changes.
Let us explore a diﬀerent type of change.

 Take two glass tumblers or small transparent bottles. Mark

 Fill one-fourth of glass tumbler A with tap water and
one-fourth of glass tumbler B with lime water.
 Now, blow air (exhale) into each glass tumbler, one at a time,
using separate straws (Fig. 5.2) and observe them.

Chapter 5.indd 60

Do you notice any changes?
In glass tumbler A, blowing air into water creates bubbles
only, and there is no change in the appearance of the water. In
glass tumbler B, blowing air into lime water creates bubbles, and
turns the lime water milky (or cloudy). If we leave it for some
time, a white substance settles at the bottom of the glass tumbler,
indicating something new has formed. Such changes, in which
one or more new substances are formed, are called chemical
changes. New substances are formed through a process called
chemical reaction. In this case, carbon dioxide from the air you
breathe out (exhale) reacts with lime water, and forms a new
white-coloured substance (calcium carbonate) that is insoluble
in water. Therefore, the liquid in the bottle appears milky. Along
with this a small amount of water is also formed. This formation
of a new substance indicates a chemical change. The chemical
reaction involved in this change can be represented in short
form as a chemical equation.

The turning of lime water milky is also used as a test for
carbon dioxide. Let us explore this with another activity using
some substances from our kitchen.
Activity 5.4: Let us experiment
 Take a teaspoonful of vinegar or lemon juice in a test tube.
 Add a pinch of baking soda (sodium hydrogen carbonate)
to it.
 What do you observe?
 You would hear a ﬁzzing bubbling sound and see the gas
bubbles forming.
 Pass this gas through freshly prepared lime water kept in
another test tube, as shown in Fig. 5.3a.
 What do you observe?
 The lime water turns milky. What do you infer about the gas
formed by mixing vinegar and baking soda?
This indicates that the gas formed is carbon dioxide.
This activity can also be performed using two small used
bottles instead of test tubes and a ﬂexible straw, as shown in
Fig. 5.3b.

observe any bubble formation? Is this a physical or a chemical
change?

5.3 Some Other Processes Involving
Chemical Changes
5.3.1 Rusting
In the rusting of iron, which you studied
in the chapter ‘The World of Metals and
Non-metals’, a new brown-coloured
substance called rust is formed. Thus,
rusting is also a chemical change because
it involves the formation of a new
substance, iron oxide (Fig. 5.4).

5.3.2 Combustion

Fig. 5.4: Rusted
iron nails

Let us recall the burning of a magnesium ribbon
(Fig. 5.5) learnt in the chapter ‘The World of
Metals and Non-metals’. Can you predict if this is
a physical or a chemical change?
When the magnesium ribbon is burnt, a new
substance, magnesium oxide, is formed. So, the
burning of magnesium ribbon also involves a
chemical change. We observed that heat and light
Fig. 5.5: Burning magnesium ribbon
are also produced along with the formation of a
new substance in this reaction.
The burning of magnesium ribbon can be represented as—
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

Magnesium + Oxygen
(Ribbon)
(Air)

Magnesium oxide + Heat + Light
(White powder)

A chemical reaction in which a substance reacts with oxygen
and produces heat and/or light is called combustion. Substances
that undergo combustion reactions are called combustible
substances. For example, wood, paper, cotton, kerosene, etc.,
are combustible substances.
Let us ﬁnd out whether the presence of oxygen
is essential for combustion.
Activity 5.5: Let us investigate
 Place two identical candles on two separate
petri dishes and light them.
(a)

(b)

Fig. 5.6: Candle (a) burning
(b) covered with a glass tumbler

62

Chapter 5.indd 62

 Cover one of these with a glass tumbler, as
shown in Fig. 5.6.
 What happens to the candle ﬂames in the two
cases?

4/3/2025 4:52:49 PM

We observe that the candle that was not covered (Fig. 5.6a)
continues to burn, whereas the candle that was covered with a
glass tumbler (Fig. 5.6b) stops burning after some time. Why does
this happen?
Since the candle covered by the glass tumbler does not have
a continuous supply of air, the ﬂame gets extinguished soon.
The component of air that supports combustion is oxygen. This
can be conﬁrmed by the presence of carbon dioxide in the glass
tumbler inverted on the candle. How can you test the presence
of carbon dioxide gas?
You can test the carbon dioxide gas by adding a small amount
of lime water in the petri dish. You will notice that it turns milky.
This carbon dioxide was formed by the carbon from the wax and
the oxygen from the air. In other words, oxygen is required for
combustion.

If a person’s clothes catch ﬁre, what is the best way to extinguish
the ﬁre?
Wrap a blanket or cloth around the person. This cuts oﬀ the
supply of air, and the ﬁre gets extinguished.
Caution — Synthetic blanket or cloth should never be used to put
out a ﬁre, as these can melt and stick to the skin.

FASCINATING FACTS

Nature’s wonders: You might have
seen some insects emitting light in
a garden or a ﬁeld in late evenings.
These insects are called ﬁreﬂies, and
their light is produced by a chemical
change. This type of light production
(without heat) in living organisms is
called bioluminescence.

Fireflies

Is the Presence of Air Enough for Combustion?
We learnt above that combustible substances and oxygen
are necessary for combustion. We also know that paper is a
combustible substance, but we can keep it in the air for any
length of time without it catching ﬁre. What else is needed to
start combustion?
Let us learn about this.

Chapter 5.indd 63

4/3/2025 4:52:50 PM

Activity 5.6: Let us investigate
Caution — Perform this activity under the supervision of your teacher
or an adult.

 Hold a piece of paper with a pair of
tongs and bring a lighted matchstick
to it. It quickly catches ﬁre. Do we say
that we need a ﬁre to start the burning
process?
 Take another piece of paper. Using a
magnifying glass, focus the sunrays to
make the smallest and brightest spot on
the paper, as shown in the Fig. 5.7a.
Hold it there for some time.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

Fig. 5.7(a): Focusing the sunrays using a
magnifying glass

Fig. 5.7(b): Paper catching fire

What do you observe?
We observe that the paper starts to
emit smoke, and then catches ﬁre
(Fig. 5.7b). Thus, we ﬁnd that a substance
can burn even without ﬁre. How do we
explain this change?
Focusing sunrays on the paper heats
it. The temperature of the paper increases
with time. After some time, the paper
becomes so hot that it starts burning.
This minimum temperature at which a
substance catches ﬁre is called its ignition
temperature. Since the temperature of the
lighted matchstick was already higher than
the ignition temperature of the paper, it
caught ﬁre almost immediately.

So, we can conclude that for the combustion process to occur,
there are three requirements (Fig. 5.8) —
(i) A combustible substance, also called ‘fuel’
(ii) Oxygen
(iii) Heat that allows the fuel to reach its ignition temperature.

Occur in the Same Process?

Activity 5.7: Think, pair, and share

Maybe the wick
draws up the liquid
wax…
Fig. 5.9: What changes occur when a candle burns?

The wax of the candle melts, is carried up the wick, and
evaporates due to the heat of the ﬂame. The vapour of wax burns
to produce a ﬂame. The melting of wax, its solidiﬁcation, and
evaporation are physical changes. The burning of vapour on the
other hand, is a chemical change. This shows that the burning of
a candle involves both physical and chemical changes.

KNOW A SCIENTIST

The candle you just observed has long been an object of curiosity for
several scientists including Michael Faraday, who made signiﬁcant
contributions to several areas of science. In the
nineteenth century, Faraday delivered a series
of lectures called Chemical History of a Candle.
Faraday believed that the candle was the perfect
object to introduce scientiﬁc study. Through
it, he discussed diﬀerences between various
physical and chemical processes like melting,
vapourisation, and combustion.

5.5 Are Changes Permanent?
Once something has undergone a change, can we get it back in
its original form?
Activity 5.8: Let us think
Think again about all the changes that we have discussed
or talked about so far. In which of these can we get back the
object or substance in the form we started with? Record your
observations in Table 5.2.

Chapter 5.indd 66

Returning to the original object or substance with which we
started shows that the changes we brought can be reversed. For
example, when ice melts, it can be refrozen into ice. Similarly,
when water evaporates, it can be condensed back into liquid
water. However, some changes cannot be reversed since we
cannot get the original object or substance back after the change.
For example, chopped vegetables cannot return to their original
size and shape, and making popcorn cannot go back to its original
form. Thus, changes around us could be grouped into those that
can be reversed and those that cannot be reversed.

5.6 Are All Changes Desirable?
Many useful changes happen in our daily life. For example, the
changing of milk into curd, ripening of fruits, cutting of fruits,
and cooking of food. All these are desirable changes. Can you
think of some other desirable changes happening around you?

4/3/2025 4:52:53 PM

On the other hand, some changes may be undesirable, such
as the rusting of iron or the decay of food during its storage.
A change that is undesirable in some situations may be desirable
in other situations. For example, decomposition of food can be
very useful in converting food waste into compost.
Some changes occurring over the years due to human activity
can have a long-term environmental impact. For example, the
increased consumption of fuels in cars, trains, aeroplanes, etc.,
is increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Drying of paint on walls, doors, furniture, etc., releases many
substances through evaporation, causing atmospheric pollution.

5.7 Some Slow Natural Changes
5.7.1 Weathering of rocks
Have you seen heaps of sand, soil, and stones lying at the base of
mountains as shown in Fig. 5.10a? These are called sediments. How
have these formed? These are formed by physical changes that
break up large rocks into smaller pieces. Temperature changes due
to climatic conditions, growing roots of trees, and even freezing of
water within cracks in the rocks can cause them to break.
Water or chemicals present in water, can also react with
the rocks and cause chemical changes in their composition. An
example of such a chemical change is shown in Fig. 5.10b. Here,
an originally black-coloured rock called basalt, which contains
iron, has chemically changed to produce a red-coloured layer. The
red colour is a result of the iron oxide produced when the rock
surface was exposed for a long time to water or air containing
water vapour. These physical and chemical changes in rocks are
collectively called weathering, which eventually leads to the
formation of soil.

5.7.2 Erosion
Have you noticed ﬁne sand collecting on riverbeds or in lakes?
This sand is formed when rock pebbles, soil, and sediments are
broken down and moved from one location to another by natural
forces like wind and ﬂowing water. This process is called erosion.
Erosion during a landslide is an example of a physical change.
River rocks and pebbles often appear smoother due to the
constant erosion caused by the ﬂowing water. When the speed
of the water or wind decreases, such as in an ocean or a lake, the
material transported during erosion settles down at the bottom.
These sediments harden over time and become new rocks. Most
of these changes take place over thousands of years and cannot
be reversed.

In a Nutshell
 A physical change is one in which a substance or object
undergoes a change in its physical properties and no new
substance is formed.
 A chemical change is one in which one or more new
substances are formed. It involves a chemical reaction and
can be represented by a chemical equation.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

 Combustion, cooking, and rusting are examples of chemical
changes.
 Substances that undergo combustion are combustible
substances. Heat and/or light are given out during
combustion.
 The lowest temperature at which a substance can catch ﬁre
is called its ignition temperature.
 Some changes can be reversed and some cannot.
 Some changes are desirable and some are not.
 Rocks undergo physical and chemical changes due to
weathering to form soil.
 Erosion caused by ﬂowing water and wind is a physical
change.
