Adolescence:
A Stage of Growth
and Change

The journey of a plant generally begins with the germination of a
seed. With proper nourishment, the seed becomes a sapling and
matures into a young plant. This journey is marked by some specific
changes. Some of the visible changes are an increase in its height, the
appearance of more leaves, and the development of flowers, fruits,
and new seeds. From these seeds, new plants emerge.
It is quite unlikely that a seedling will develop the capabilities
to produce its own seeds immediately after germination. It needs
to grow and reach maturity to become capable of producing
seeds. Similarly, animals also need to grow and reach maturity
before they can reproduce. Some animals lay eggs that hatch
into young ones, while others, like humans, directly give birth to
young ones. In both cases, the young ones gradually grow in size
and develop over time.

The journey of life of a human can be divided into different
stages—infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age.
Each person experiences these stages at their own pace, and the
duration of each stage may vary from one individual to another.
From infancy to adulthood, our bodies undergo various changes.
Until around 10–12 years of age, most changes are related to
height and weight. After this, other noticeable changes begin to
occur, marking the onset of adolescence. This is a period of rapid
growth and development, typically occurring between the ages
of 10–19. During adolescence, the body prepares for adulthood.
Humans, like most other living beings, can not reproduce
immediately after their birth. Their bodies need to grow and
reach a stage of maturity to be able to reproduce.
As humans grow and develop, they experience significant
physical, emotional, and behavioural changes, along with the
ability to reproduce. Some of these changes may be quite clearly
observable, while others occur internally and may go unnoticed.
In this chapter, you will explore adolescence, understand its
importance, and learn how to handle it with a sense of responsibility.

6.1 Growing With Age: The Teenage Years

During the summer vacation, Venkatesh visited his grandparents.
As he entered the house, his 12-year-old cousin, Devyani came
running to greet him.

 Fold the slips and place them in the jar.

Have you also experienced some of these changes? If yes, then
it is because you are also reaching this stage gradually. This stage
starts around 10 years of age and can continue up to the age of
19. It is usually a stage of development between childhood and
adulthood, and is called adolescence.
While analysing Table 6.1, you might have noticed the following:

Increase in height
From birth, our body undergoes continuous growth
and development including an increase in height.
However, the increase in height becomes more
prominent during adolescence.

Changes in body structure, weight gain, and
strength
As boys grow, it might be seen that along with growing
taller, they gain weight, their shoulders might become
a bit broader, and their chests may get wider.
Girls also undergo changes in height and weight,
and other body changes like development of breasts.

Chapter 6.indd 75

04-04-2025 04:25:30

Changes in voice

Adam's
apple

In adolescent boys, the growth of the voice box leads
to a voice that sounds hoarse. The voice box is a
structure in our throat that helps us to speak. The
growth may be seen as a bump in the throat region
and is called the Adam’s apple. However, it is not
noticeable in every individual. The voice box also
grows in adolescent girls but it is not as big as in the
boys, leading to only slight changes in voice.

Appearance of hair in different parts of body
Both boys and girls experience the growth of hair in
different parts of their bodies, such as the armpits and
pubic region.
Boys often develop facial hair, which later grows
into a moustache and a beard as they move towards
adulthood. Some boys may also develop chest hair and
back hair, though few boys may have no significant
hair growth. Variations in and timing of appearance of
hair growth is completely normal.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

Changes in facial skin: emergence of pimples
Another common occurrence during the adolescent
years is a skin condition called acne, in which small,
reddish pimples appear. These are commonly visible
on the face. Acne occurs due to an increase in oily
secretions from the skin during adolescence that can
clog the skin pores and lead to infections. While acne
is a condition, pimples are a manifestation of it.

A key point to remember
Whether it is a change in height, voice, or facial hair, it is
important to recognise that the timing, nature, and extent
of these changes vary among individuals. These variations
are completely normal.
Each person experiences adolescence at his or her
own pace, and its duration also varies from one person to
another.

76

Chapter 6.indd 76

04-04-2025 04:25:32

Now, we have understood some of the changes that take place
during adolescence, particularly those that are easily observable.
Some of these characteristic changes, like change in voice, the growth
of facial and chest hair in boys, and the development of breasts
in girls are not directly involved in the process of reproduction.
However, these characteristic changes help distinguish males
from females. For this reason, they are called secondary sexual
characteristics.
Secondary sexual characteristics are natural signs that the
body is preparing for adulthood. They mark the onset of puberty.
Puberty is the stage in which the body of an adolescent undergoes
external and internal changes to develop into an adult capable of
reproduction.

6.2 Changes that Indicate Reproductive
Capability

Adolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change

77

Adolescence is marked not only by observable changes but also
by internal changes that are not visible from the outside. One such
change is the maturation of various parts involved in the process
of reproduction.
Both boys and girls experience such changes gradually, and
these changes are a natural part of the process of growing up.
An important internal change associated with adolescent girls is
the onset of the menstrual cycle. It recurs generally every 28–30
days and is more commonly known as ‘the period’. Many healthy
girls may have longer or shorter menstrual cycles ranging from
21–35 days. The menstrual cycle is an important natural process
and is one of the signs of good reproductive health. The phase of
the cycle when blood discharge occurs from the body is referred
to as menstruation. It may last for three to seven days. Some girls
may feel pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen during these
days. Usually, by the age of 45–55, menstruation stops naturally,
marking the end of the reproductive capability in a woman’s life.
Breaking myths about menstruation
There are many wrong beliefs about menstruation that
often lead to unnecessary fear, shame, or even guilt. These
beliefs have given rise to certain myths and taboos. Among
such myths and taboos, physical isolation of menstruating
girls is unfortunately still quite prevalent. Menstruation is a
natural process, and such myths have no scientific basis. By
encouraging a scientific outlook towards menstruation, we can
help society appreciate the need to promote good reproductive
health of women and contribute positively towards a healthier
lifestyle for women.

Chapter 6.indd 77

04-04-2025 04:25:33

Adolescence is not just about physical changes or changes
associated with reproductive capability but also about emotional
and behavioural changes. Let us discuss them!

6.3 Emotional and Behavioural Changes
in Adolescents
Activity 6.2: Let us list
Take a moment to think if there are any changes in your emotions
or behaviour or that of your classmates and friends in the past
one or two years. These changes may be exciting, confusing, or
both.
Let us list some emotional changes in Table 6.2 along with
their probable effects on behaviour and ways for positive growth
and development.

ways for positive growth and development

Increased sensitivity

Compassion, involvement in
social work

Any other

While discussing Table 6.2, you may have explored the
diverse behavioural changes in adolescents. This is because
adolescence is often marked by stronger emotions than
childhood. These emotions might affect adolescents’ behaviour
like taking up/joining social initiatives to support the needy and
the disadvantaged, or developing deeper interest in new areas.
Understanding how our emotions influence our behaviour
and actions, can help us make better choices and respond to
situations thoughtfully.

6.4 Making Adolescence a Joyful
Experience
The journey of adolescence is a unique experience. Heightened
curiosity and excitement during this stage of life give adolescents
a new viewpoint towards almost everything around them.
Good habits, thoughtful decisions, and small actions can have a
powerful positive impact on the overall well-being of adolescents.
Let us know about them!

6.4.1 Meeting nutritional needs
In Grade 6 chapter ‘Mindful Eating: A Path to a Healthy Body’,
you learnt about the need for a healthy diet. Since adolescence is
a period of growth and development marked by several changes
in the body, a nutritious diet is of utmost importance.

For proper growth, and to perform
well on the playground, we need
proteins and carbohydrates!
Not only that, we also need
an adequate amount of fats,
vitamins, and minerals as well!

Based on the locally available foods, fill Table 6.3 with the healthy
food sources, nutrients present in them and how these nutrients
can help our growth and development.

6.4.2 Personal hygiene

Fig. 6.1: Sanitary pad

Chapter 6.indd 80

Besides nutrition, personal hygiene is also crucially important during
adolescence. Maintaining body hygiene, particularly in the armpits
and the pubic region, may protect us from potential infections.
For girls, maintaining proper hygiene during menstruation
is essential for both comfort and health. Menstrual hygiene can
be maintained using items such as sanitary pads (Fig. 6.1) and
reusable cloth pads designed for this purpose.
The government also attempts to provide these products free
of charge or at a low price to improve the menstrual hygiene of
girls and women. As a society, we should all make efforts to ensure
the availability of necessary facilities in schools and public places
to promote menstrual hygiene. Collectively, we should move
forward, reducing any stigma around sanitary pads and helping
in menstrual hygiene.
It is important to dispose of used sanitary pads properly by
wrapping them in newspaper and disposing inside a dustbin. This
is to ensure community health and environmental cleanliness.
These days, biodegradable sanitary pads are also available that
are environment-friendly.

04-04-2025 04:25:36

Science and Society

To support menstrual hygiene, the government has introduced
several initiatives—
 Menstrual Hygiene Scheme (MHS): Under this scheme by the
Government of India, sanitary pads are provided free of charge
or at a reduced price to adolescent girls in rural areas. Awareness
programmes are also conducted to educate girls about menstrual
hygiene and health.
 Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK): It aims to
improve the overall health of adolescents, including menstrual
health and hygiene. It encourages peer education, where older
students help younger ones learn about these topics.
 Suvidha Sanitary Napkin Initiative: Under this initiative,
biodegradable sanitary pads are provided at affordable prices
through Jan Aushadhi Kendras. The initiative aims to improve access
to menstrual hygiene products for women and adolescent girls.
 State-Level Initiatives: Various state governments have their
own programmes, such as the ‘Shuchi Scheme’ in Karnataka
and free sanitary napkin schemes in states like Tamil Nadu and
Odisha. These programmes aim to distribute free sanitary pads in
government schools.

6.4.3 Physical activities
Regular exercise and physical activities are also very important
during adolescence. Do you exercise regularly or participate in
games and sports? What kinds of exercises do you do? These
activities will keep your body and mind fit and healthy, build up
your stamina and boost your mood (Fig. 6.2).

6.4.4 Balanced social life
We all live in a society and interact with each other in our day-to-day
life. We should all be polite and respectful towards each other
(Fig. 6.3). This helps create a favourable and safe environment.
Since adolescence is a stage of life marked by new experiences
and emotions, we must be thoughtful and responsible while
interacting with others — whether in person or through social
media. This is the time adolescents may feel attracted to their
peers, and mimic their behaviour. Today, they often interact
with each other online.

Modern technologies have made online platforms
available for all to obtain information, make
connections, interact, and share information with
each other. We should use these platforms responsibly
for the collective well-being of all. Sometimes, we,
knowingly or unknowingly, use social media platforms
carelessly. Seeking guidance from elders and teachers
can help use these platforms positively.

Fig. 6.4: Cyberbullying

Science and Society

Cyberbullying involves the use of digital devices such as phones,
computers, or online platforms to harass others by sending misleading
messages, spreading false rumours, or sharing personal information
without consent (Fig. 6.4). However, if someone tries to bully you, it is
important not to feel scared or helpless. Rather, handle it wisely and
seek help from parents and teachers.
Additionally, you should be cautious when uploading any picture
online or sharing personal information with strangers.

6.4.5 Avoiding harmful substances — learn to
say NO
Some people, including your peers, may tempt, persuade, force or,
create pressure on you to consume harmful substances such as
tobacco, gutka, cigarettes, beedi, alcohol, or even life-threatening
illegal drugs. Since adolescence is marked by curiosity and
excitement, adolescents might get influenced by such people and try
these substances.
These substances are not just harmful to physical and mental
health but are also addictive. This means that once people start
consuming them, they develop a strong urge to take them again
and again. Over time, they start using them regularly. This is called
substance abuse.

Say no to

substances the
first time and
every time!

Using these substances can cause serious health problems,
such as breathing difficulties, memory loss, and damage to the
lungs (Fig. 6.5), depending on the substance. To stay healthy, it is
important to completely avoid these substances and make healthy
choices instead. It is important to remain firm and confident in
your decision to say ‘NO’.
The first step to overcoming addiction is seeking help and
support from family and friends, and talking to trusted people,
such as parents or teachers. Counselling and medical advice can
also be helpful in handling such situations. Remember, your
health and your future are in your hands — choose wisely!

Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan
The Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan was launched by the Ministry
of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India. It
intends to reach out to the masses and spread awareness on the
issue of avoiding substance abuse through active participation of
the youth, women, and the community. The special focus is on the
prevention of substance abuse among early-age children.
The Government has launched a National De-addiction Helpline—
14446, to deal with drug addiction and to help drug addicts.

6.5 The ‘Why’ Question for Adolescence

84

Chapter 6.indd 84

We now understand the different
changes in adolescence and also know
some ways to handle it with a sense of
responsibility.
But I wonder why these
changes occur at this stage
of life!

Many changes in adolescence, including menstruation and
other signs of puberty, are mainly due to hormones — certain
chemicals produced in our bodies. Hormones play a crucial
role in regulating various aspects of growth and development,
contributing to the proper functioning of the body. They are
produced in different parts of the body and are released at an
appropriate time in response to signals from the brain. Some
hormones influence mood and behaviour.

04-04-2025 04:25:42

By staying informed, seeking support and guidance when
needed, and making healthy decisions, you can build a strong
foundation for your life ahead.

In a Nutshell
 Adolescence is the period of change from childhood to
adulthood. It generally begins around the age of 10 years
and usually lasts until 19 years.
 Adolescence is marked by significant and characteristic
physical, biological, and emotional changes.
 Features that help to distinguish the male from the female
but are not directly involved in reproduction are called
secondary sexual characteristics.
 Puberty is the stage in which the body of a child undergoes
observable and internal changes to develop into an adult
capable of reproduction.
 Adolescence in girls is also marked by start of the menstrual
cycle, during which there is a discharge of blood generally
after every 28–30 days, a process called menstruation.
Menstruation begins at puberty and generally ends by the
age of 45–55 years.
 Adolescents face several emotional and behavioural changes.
 Eating a balanced and healthy diet, maintaining good
personal hygiene, and participating in physical activities
help adolescents to stay healthy.
 Addictive substances, such as tobacco, alcohol, and drugs,
have adverse effects on the body and mind. It is wise to say
‘NO’ to these substances and stay away from them.
 Changes that take place in the body during adolescence are
primarily controlled by certain chemicals produced in the
body. These chemicals are called hormones.
 Proper guidance and awareness help adolescents manage
physical, emotional, and behavioural changes effectively.
