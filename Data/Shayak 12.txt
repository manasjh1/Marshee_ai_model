Life Processes
in Plants

In Grade 6, we learnt that all living beings grow and need food
for their growth. Also, in the previous chapter, we discussed the
process through which animals obtain nutrition.
We know that animals eat food to grow, but what about
plants? Have you ever seen plants eating food like animals do?
As animals grow, their size and weight usually increase, and their
bodies undergo various changes. What changes do you notice in
plants when they grow?
We learnt that food provides nutrients like carbohydrates,
fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals, which, along with water,
are all essential for growth. Let us explore how plants obtain
nutrients for their growth.

10.1 How Do Plants Grow?
Look around your neighbourhood. Have you observed any
changes in a plant during its life span? As a plant grows, new
leaves and branches emerge, its height increases, and its stem
thickens. What do you think causes these changes? Discuss with
your friends and provide your explanation as well.

When we water plants
regularly, they grow better.
So, I think water also
contributes to its growth.

I think sunlight plays
some role in the growth
of plants.

Maybe plants take
up food from the soil
through their roots.

I think, maybe, ________
plays some role!

Let us perform an experiment to test some of these explanations.

Activity 10.1: Let us test some explanations
 Take three earthen pots (or used bottles/containers) of the
same size ﬁlled with garden soil. Plant saplings of similar sizes
of a fast-growing plant like chilli or
tomato in each pot (Fig. 10.1).
 Label the pots A, B, and C.
 Count the number of leaves on
each sapling and record your
observations.


 Place pot A in direct sunlight. Keep
the soil in this pot slightly moist

 Observe the plants for two weeks1 and record changes in
their height, number of leaves, colour of leaves, and any
other changes that may appear.
 Record your observations in Table 10.1.

 What diﬀerences did you observe between the plants in the
three pots?
 Which pot has the plant with the maximum growth?
 Which pot has the plant with the least growth?
Analyse the observations recorded in Table 10.1, and discuss
them with your teacher and friends.
You are likely to ﬁnd that the plant in Pot A, kept in direct
sunlight with adequate water, grows better than the plant in Pot
C, which gets adequate water but no sunlight. The plant in Pot
B may have died as it did not get water even though it received
adequate sunlight.
What do you infer from the observations made in this activity?
The results indicate that plants require both sunlight and water
for their growth.
1 This experiment will need two weeks. Teachers can plan this activity
accordingly.

“Trees do not produce fruits and flowers merely because they are planted.”
This line is from an ancient Indian text named Vrikshayurveda.. It records
useful observations about plant growth, soil, and agricultural practices to
help improve crop health, growth and production. The knowledge in the
text seems to be based on practical experiences and patterns seen over
time. These ideas were then systematically documented to guide farming
practices. For instance, there are references to diﬀerent methods of organic
manure preparation, such as mixing water, barley, and various seeds, like
green, black, and horse grams.

10.2 How Do Plants Get Food for their
Growth?
We know that animals get their food from plants, either directly by
eating plants or indirectly by eating animals that in turn eat plants
for their nutrition and growth. But how do plants obtain the food
they need to grow? Unlike animals, plants do not eat food.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

10.2.1 Leaves: the ̒ food factories ̓ of plants
Plants store food in the form of starch, a type of carbohydrate.
This starch is produced in the leaves of a plant which, by design,
are generally broad and ﬂat. These are mostly green because of
the presence of a green pigment called chlorophyll, that helps in
capturing sunlight eﬃciently.
Let us ﬁnd out the role chlorophyll plays in the preparation of
food in the form of starch in plants.

 If the colour of the leaf changes to blue-black, it indicates the
presence of starch.
Caution — Alcohol should never be placed near a heat source directly,
as it is highly ﬂammable and can easily lead to ﬁre and burns.

Did you wonder why we decolourise the leaf in the
beginning of this activity?

DIVE
EEPER

Life Processes in Plants

 Take out the leaf and place it on a plate.

Decolourisation of a leaf enables us to easily observe
colour change and, thus, the presence of starch.

In Activity 10.1, we have learnt that water and sunlight are
essential for plant growth. In Activity 10.2, we have discovered
that green leaves store starch as food.
Bhaskar loves gardening during his free time. Being a curious
student, he often looks around his garden and wonders how
plants produce food. From his experiences, Bhaskar knows
that water and sunlight are essential for plant growth. But he
wonders if sunlight contributes to the production of food in the
form of starch in plants.

How does sunlight
contribute in the production
of starch in plants?

Activity 10.3: Let us check
Bhaskar took a leaf having both green and non-green patches
from each of two similar potted plants — one kept in sunlight and
the other kept in the dark for 36 hours. He wanted to compare
the leaves before and after the starch test.
He made a sketch of the leaves to record the location of the
green and the non-green patches on them with the help of a
tracing paper. After that, he performed an iodine test (as shown
in Activity 10.2) on the leaves. Bhaskar recorded his observations
in Table 10.2.

In Table 10.2, Bhaskar recorded a blue-black colour (indicating
the presence of starch) on the green patches of the leaf obtained
from the plant placed in sunlight. Bhaskar also recorded that the
leaf obtained from the plant kept in the dark does not show a
blue-black colour, even on the green patches, indicating that no
starch has been produced. Non-green patches of the leaf obtained
from the plant placed in sunlight do not turn blue-black. Does it
indicate that there is no chlorophyll present in those patches?
The non-green patches may not have suﬃcient chlorophyll to
prepare enough starch to be detected using the iodine test.

FASCINATING FACTS

Some plant leaves appear red, violet,
or brown because they contain more
of these coloured pigments than the
green-coloured chlorophyll. This hides
the green colour. Some of these pigments
also help in photosynthesis. You can use
an iodine test to check for the presence
of starch in these leaves, indicating that
photosynthesis has indeed taken place.


Life Processes in Plants

What do we infer from the observations listed in Table 10.2?
As we know, leaves are mostly green because of the presence
of chlorophyll. We have also seen that the starch is produced
where green patches of the leaf are present. We can infer that
chlorophyll helps in preparing starch in the presence of sunlight.
In fact, it is essential for the preparation of starch. Hence, the
leaves are also called ‘food factories’ of plants.
What else is essential for the preparation of food in plants?
Let us ﬁnd out.

10.2.2 Role of air in the preparation of food
While reading contributions of
scien
scientists in plant nutrition, my sister
told me that air plays a role in the
process of food preparation in plants.
Which gas from the air is
essential in the process of
food preparation in plants?

Activity 10.4: Let us experiment
(demonstration activity)
The teacher may demonstrate this activity.
 Take a potted green plant and keep it in the
dark for two to three days to allow it to destarch
(i.e., lose any stored starch). Then, locate one
leaf of this plant for this experiment.
 Take a wide-mouthed bottle and pour some
caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) into it
(caustic soda absorbs carbon dioxide from
the air).
Caution — Caustic soda is a strong chemical that can
cause skin burns; only teachers should handle it.

 Insert half of the destarched leaf into the
bottle through a split cork, leaving the other
half of the leaf outside, and place the bottle as
shown in Fig. 10.3a.

Part of the leaf

bottle

We notice that the part of the leaf that was outside the bottle
turns blue-black, indicating the presence of starch. However, the
part of the leaf inside the bottle does not turn blue-black in colour,
indicating that food is not made in that part of the leaf. This is
because the caustic soda solution inside the ﬂask absorbs the
carbon dioxide present in the air. What does this experiment show?
This experiment shows that carbon dioxide present in the air
is essential for plants to prepare starch.
Based on Activities 10.3 and 10.4, what do you conclude?
Which part of the plant is involved in the synthesis of starch?
Based on our learnings so far, we have found that sunlight,
water, chlorophyll and carbon dioxide are essential for the
synthesis of food in plants. This process by which plants prepare
food in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll is called
photosynthesis. A leaf is the primary site for photosynthesis. Do
other green parts of the plant also perform photosynthesis? Yes,
other parts of the plants which have chlorophyll also perform
photosynthesis.
So far, we have learnt that plants take in carbon dioxide from
the air and water, and use sunlight to prepare their food by the
process of photosynthesis. But have you ever thought about what
more happens during this process? Do plants only take in

substances from their surroundings, or do they also release
something? Let us explore this through an experiment performed
by Barkha didi.

Activity 10.5: Let us explore
 Look at Fig. 10.4. Compare the
two set-ups labelled as A and B,
and analyse.
 In Fig. 10.4, set-up A is placed in
sunlight, and set-up B is placed in
the dark. What diﬀerence do you
observe in the two set-ups? Do
you observe air bubbles emerging
in the inverted test tube in set-up
A? The gas produced in this set-up
caused bubbles to emerge and get
accumulated in the inverted test
tube. Which gas is this?

Oh yes! I remember. In our science lab, I
have seen a similar set-up placed under
sunlight near a window.

When suﬃcient gas was accumulated in the
inverted test tube, Barkha didi placed her
thumb on the mouth of the test tube while
taking the test tube oﬀ the set-up. She then
quickly inserted a lit matchstick into the tube
and the matchstick produced an intense ﬂame.

She inferred that the gas in the test tube is rich in
oxygen. It indicates that oxygen is released during
the process of photosynthesis. It also indicates that
photosynthesis occurs in the presence of sunlight.

Based on Barkha didi’s experiment, we can conclude that
oxygen is released during photosynthesis.

10.2.3 Photosynthesis: in a
nutshell
We know that water, sunlight, carbon
dioxide from the air, and chlorophyll
are necessary to carry out the process
of photosynthesis that produces
carbohydrates (Fig. 10.5). During
photosynthesis,
food
is
actually
produced in the form of glucose, a
simple carbohydrate. This glucose not
only serves as an instant source of
energy but also later gets converted into
starch for storage. The word equation
of photosynthesis is given below —

Carbon dioxide + Water

Sunlight
Chlorophyll

Glucose + Oxygen

KNOW A SCIENTIST

Many scientists across the world contributed to develop an
understanding of photosynthesis. In India, Rustom Hormusji Dastur
(1896–1961) studied the process of photosynthesis.
He was a plant scientist and served as the head of the
Botany Department at the Royal Institute of Science,
Bombay (now the Institute of Science, Mumbai), from
1921–1935. He studied eﬀects of the amount of water
and temperature on photosynthesis. He examined the
importance of water, temperature, and the colour of
light in the process of photosynthesis.

10.2.4 How do leaves exchange gases during
photosynthesis?
We now know that photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide, and
oxygen is released in the process. Which part of the plant helps in
the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen? Let us conduct an
activity to understand where the exchange of gases takes place.

The teacher may demonstrate this activity.
 Collect a leaf from a plant such as rhoeo,
money plant, onion, hibiscus, coleus, or
any grass.

Activity 10.6: Let us examine

Stomata

 Put it in a beaker ﬁlled with water.
 Carefully peel a thin layer from the lower
surface of the leaf.
 Place the peel in a watch glass with water.
 Now, take a microscope slide and
carefully put a drop of water on it.
 Using forceps, transfer the peel of the leaf
from the watch glass to the slide with the
help of forceps.
 Put a drop of ink on the leaf peel with the
help of a dropper.
 Cover the peel with a coverslip and
observe it under a microscope.



Fig. 10.6: Stomata on the lower
surface of a rhoeo leaf

What do you observe? Do you notice tiny
pores on the peel, as shown in Fig. 10.6?
These pores are called stomata. Stomata, present on the surface
of leaves, help in the exchange of gases.

10.3 Transport in Plants
10.3.1 Transport of water and minerals
All living beings need water to grow. Plants use water in the
process of photosynthesis. Water, along with minerals present in
the soil, is taken up by the roots of a plant. Minerals are important
nutrients for the growth of plants. How do water and minerals
taken up by the roots move to all parts of the plant?
We can study water transport in plants by carrying out an
activity. For this activity, we require two glass tumblers, some
water, red ink, and twigs of two similar tender plants, preferably
with white-coloured ﬂowers (for example, white sadabahar,
balsam), as shown in Fig. 10.7.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

Activity 10.7: Let us experiment
 Take two tumblers and label them A and B.
 Fill one-third of each tumbler with water.
 Add a few drops of red ink to tumbler B.
 Obliquely cut the stems of both plants at their

Fig. 10.8: Transport of water
and minerals in a plant

We know that leaves are the primary site for
photosynthesis. The food prepared by plants in the
leaves is transported to all parts of the plant. This
food is transported through another set of thin
tube-like structures called the phloem (Fig. 10.8).
The transported food may also be stored in some
other parts of a plant, such as seeds and roots.



In the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, chapter ‘Living
Creatures: Exploring their Characteristics’, you learnt that all
living beings respire. Do plants also respire like we do?
Activity 10.8: Let us ﬁnd out

 Soak some moong bean seeds in water overnight.
 Put a layer of cotton in a conical ﬂask (Fig. 10.9) and moisten

 Cover the mouth of one test tube with a

Fig. 10.9: Set-up to test respiration in plants
 Dip one glass tube in the test tube
through a hole in the cork.
 Connect the ﬂask and test tube with a rubber pipe as shown
in Fig. 10.9.
Compare both the test tubes for any change in colour. Does
the lime water turn milky in both the test tubes? Why does the
lime water turn milky in the test tube connected to the ﬂask?
Lime water turns milky due to the presence of more carbon
dioxide in the ﬂask. But where does this carbon dioxide come
from? As we know, carbon dioxide is naturally present in very
small quantities in the air. In the ﬂask, additional carbon dioxide
is produced by the seeds as they respire.
During respiration, glucose is broken down in the presence of
oxygen, releasing carbon dioxide, water, and energy. The word
equation for the proccess of respiration, is as follows —
Glucose + Oxygen

Life Processes in Plants

10.4 Do Plants Respire?

Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy

The energy produced during respiration is used by plants
for their growth and development. All parts of a plant, green or
non-green, carry out respiration.
Thus, plants have diﬀerent mechanisms for synthesising,
transporting, and utilising food to get energy.

In a Nutshell
 All living organisms require food that provide energy for
their growth and development.
 Plants use carbon dioxide and water in the presence of
sunlight and chlorophyll to produce glucose and oxygen.
This process of synthesis of food is known as photosynthesis.
 Leaves are the ̒ food factories ̓ of a plant.
 Tiny pores on the surface of leaves, called stomata, help
in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide during
photosynthesis and respiration.
 The xylem transports water and minerals from roots, while
the phloem carries food from leaves to all parts of the plants.
 Plants break down glucose and release energy by a process
called respiration. They use oxygen and release carbon
dioxide in this process.

KNOW A SCIENTIST

Kamala Sohonie (1911–1998) was a woman scientist of India. She
received a Ph.D. degree for her remarkable contribution in the area of
respiration in plants from Cambridge University.
She returned to India and worked at the Lady
Hardinge Medical College in New Delhi, and later
at the Nutrition Research Laboratory, Coonoor.
Thereafter, she moved to the then Royal Institute
of Science, Bombay, where she was eventually
appointed as Director. Much of her work helped
improve the nutritive values of plant foods. She
also worked on the sap of the coconut palm as a
nutritive drink called Neera.
